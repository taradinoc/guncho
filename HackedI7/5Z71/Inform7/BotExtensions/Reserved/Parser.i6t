B/parst: Parser Template.
 
@Purpose: The parser for turning the text of the typed command into a proposed
action by the player.

@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@p Grammar Line Variables.
This is the I6 library parser in mostly untouched form: reformatted for template
file use, and with paragraph divisions, but otherwise hardly changed at all.
It is a complex algorithm but one which is known to produce good results for
the most part, and it is well understood from (at time of writing) fifteen
years of use. A few I7 additions have been made, but none disrupting the
basic method. For instance, I7's system for resolving ambiguities is
implemented by providing a |ChooseObjects| routine, just as a user of the
I6 library would do.

The I6 parser uses a huge number of global variables, which is not to modern
programming tastes: in the early days of Inform, the parser was essentially
written in assembly-language only lightly structured by C-like syntaxes,
and the Z-machine's 240 globals were more or less registers. The I6 library
made no distinction between which were ``private'' to the parser and which
allowed to be accessed by the user's code at large. The I7 template does
impose that boundary, though not very strongly: the variables defined
in ``Output.i6t'' are for general access, while the ones below should only
be read or written by the parser.

                                    ! (Used for full stops and "then".)

                                    ! the above if user's routines match multi-word verbs)

@p Grammar Token Variables.
More globals, but dealing at the level of individual tokens now.

Global multi_had;                   ! Number of things actually found
Global multi_context;               ! What token the multi-obj was accepted for

Global indef_mode;                  ! "Indefinite" mode - ie, "take a brick"
                                    ! is in this mode

Global indef_wanted;                ! Number of items wanted (INDEF_ALL_WANTED for all)
Constant INDEF_ALL_WANTED = 32767;

Global indef_owner;                 ! Object which must hold these items
Global indef_cases;                 ! Possible gender and numbers of them

                                    ! been made about meaning of a descriptor?

                                    ! (Not a flag: possible values 0, 1, 2)

                                    ! for commas in parse buffers

@p Match List Variables.
The most difficult tokens to match are those which refer to objects, since
there is such a variety of names which can be given to any individual object,
and we don't of course know which object or objects are meant. We store the
possibilities (up to |MATCH_LIST_WORDS|, anyway) in a data structure called the match list.

@c
Array  match_list --> MATCH_LIST_WORDS;    ! An array of matched objects so far
Array  match_classes --> MATCH_LIST_WORDS; ! An array of equivalence classes for them
Array  match_scores --> MATCH_LIST_WORDS;  ! An array of match scores for them
Global number_matched;              ! How many items in it?  (0 means none)
Global number_of_classes;           ! How many equivalence classes?
Global match_length;                ! How many words long are these matches?
Global match_from;                  ! At what word of the input do they begin?

@p Words.
The player's command is broken down into a numbered sequence of words, which
break at spaces or certain punctuation (see the DM4). The numbering runs
upwards from 1 to |WordCount()|. The following utility routines provide
access to words in the current command; because buffers have different
definitions in Z and Glulx, so these routines must vary also.

The actual text of each word is stored as a sequence of ZSCII values in
a |->| (byte) array, with address |WordAddress(x)| and length |WordLength(x)|.

We picture the command as a stream of words to be read one at a time, with
the global variable |wn| being the ``current word'' marker. |NextWord|, which
takes no arguments, returns:
(a) 0 if the word at |wn| is unrecognised by the dictionary or |wn| is out
of range,
(b) |comma_word| if the word was a comma,
(c) |THEN1__WD| if it was a full stop (because of the Infocom tradition that
a full stop abbreviates for the word ``then'': e.g., TAKE BOX. EAST was read
as two commands in succession),
(d) or the dictionary address if the word was recognised.

The current word marker |wn| is always advanced.

|NextWordStopped| does the same, but returns $-1$ when |wn| is out of range
(e.g., by having advanced past the last word in the command).

|MoveWord(at1, b2, at2)| copies word |at2| from parse buffer |b2| -- which
doesn't need to be |buffer| -- to word |at1| in |parse|.

@c
#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE;
[ WordCount; return parse->1; ];
[ WordAddress wordnum; return buffer + parse->(wordnum*4+1); ];
[ WordLength wordnum; return parse->(wordnum*4); ];
[ MoveWord at1 b2 at2 x y;
    x = at1*2-1; y = at2*2-1;
    parse-->x++ = b2-->y++;
    parse-->x = b2-->y;
];
#Ifnot;
[ WordCount; return parse-->0; ];
[ WordAddress wordnum; return buffer + parse-->(wordnum*3); ];
[ WordLength wordnum; return parse-->(wordnum*3-1); ];
[ MoveWord at1 b2 at2 x y;
    x = at1*3-2; y = at2*3-2;
    parse-->x++ = b2-->y++;
    parse-->x++ = b2-->y++;
    parse-->x = b2-->y;
];
#Endif;

[ NextWord i j wc;
	#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; wc = parse->1; i = wn*2-1;
	#Ifnot; wc = parse-->0; i = wn*3-2; #Endif;
    wn++;
    if ((wn < 2) || (wn > wc+1)) return 0;
    j = parse-->i;
    if (j == ',//') j = comma_word;
    if (j == './/') j = THEN1__WD;
    return j;
];

[ NextWordStopped wc;
	#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; wc = parse->1; #Ifnot; wc = parse-->0; #Endif;
	if ((wn < 1) || (wn > wc)) { wn++; return -1; }
    return NextWord();
];

@p Snippets.
Although the idea is arguably implicit in I6, the formal concept of
``snippet'' is new in I7. A snippet is a value which represents a word
range in the command most recently typed by the player. These words number
consecutively upwards from 1, as noted above. The correspondence between
$(w_1, w_2)$, the word range, and $V$, the number used to represent it as
an I6 value, is:
$$ V = 100w_1 + (w_2-w_1+1) $$
so that the remainder mod 100 is the number of words in the range. We
require that $1\leq w_1\leq w_2\leq N$, where $N$ is the number of words in
the current player's command. The entire command is therefore represented by:
$$ C = 100 + N $$

@c
[ PrintSnippet snip from to i w1 w2;
	w1 = snip/100; w2 = w1 + (snip%100) - 1;
	if ((w2<w1) || (w1<1) || (w2>WordCount()))
		return RunTimeProblem(RTP_SAYINVALIDSNIPPET, w1, w2);
	from = WordAddress(w1); to = WordAddress(w2) + WordLength(w2) - 1;
	for (i=from: i<=to: i++) print (char) i->0;
];

[ SpliceSnippet snip t i w1 w2 nextw at endsnippet newlen;
	w1 = snip/100; w2 = w1 + (snip%100) - 1;
	if ((w2<w1) || (w1<1) || (w2>WordCount()))
		return RunTimeProblem(RTP_SPLICEINVALIDSNIPPET, w1, w2);
	@push say__p; @push say__pc;
	nextw = w2 + 1;
	at = WordAddress(w1) - buffer;
	if (nextw <= WordCount()) endsnippet = 100*nextw + (WordCount() - nextw + 1);
	buffer2-->0 = 120;
	newlen = VM_PrintToBuffer(buffer2, 120, SpliceSnippet__TextPrinter, t, endsnippet);
	for (i=0: (i<newlen) && (at+i<120): i++) buffer->(at+i) = buffer2->(WORDSIZE+i);
	#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE; buffer->1 = at+i; #ifnot; buffer-->0 = at+i; #endif;
	for (:at+i<120:i++) buffer->(at+i) = ' ';
	VM_Tokenise(buffer, parse);
	players_command = 100 + WordCount();
	@pull say__pc; @pull say__p;
];

[ SpliceSnippet__TextPrinter t endsnippet;
	PrintText(t);
	if (endsnippet) { print " "; PrintSnippet(endsnippet); }
];

[ SnippetIncludes test snippet w1 w2 wlen i j;

	if ((w2<w1) || (w1<1))
		return RunTimeProblem(RTP_INCLUDEINVALIDSNIPPET, w1, w2);
	if (metaclass(test) == Routine) {
		wlen = snippet%100;
		for (i=w1, j=wlen: j>0: i++, j--) {

@p Unpacking Grammar Lines.
Grammar lines are sequences of tokens in an array built into the story file,
but in a format which differs depending on the virtual machine in use, so
the following code unpacks the data into more convenient if larger arrays
which are VM-independent.

@c
[ UnpackGrammarLine line_address i size;
    for (i=0 : i<32 : i++) {
        line_token-->i = ENDIT_TOKEN;
        line_ttype-->i = ELEMENTARY_TT;
        line_tdata-->i = ENDIT_TOKEN;
    }
#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE;
    action_to_be = 256*(line_address->0) + line_address->1;
    action_reversed = ((action_to_be & $400) ~= 0);
    action_to_be = action_to_be & $3ff;
    line_address--;
    size = 3;
#Ifnot; ! GLULX
    @aloads line_address 0 action_to_be;
    action_reversed = (((line_address->2) & 1) ~= 0);
    line_address = line_address - 2;
    size = 5;
#Endif;
    params_wanted = 0;
    for (i=0 : : i++) {
        line_address = line_address + size;
        if (line_address->0 == ENDIT_TOKEN) break;
        line_token-->i = line_address;
        AnalyseToken(line_address);
        if (found_ttype ~= PREPOSITION_TT) params_wanted++;
        line_ttype-->i = found_ttype;
        line_tdata-->i = found_tdata;
    }
    return line_address + 1;
];

[ AnalyseToken token;
    if (token == ENDIT_TOKEN) {
        found_ttype = ELEMENTARY_TT;
        found_tdata = ENDIT_TOKEN;
        return;
    }
    found_ttype = (token->0) & $$1111;
    found_tdata = (token+1)-->0;
];

@p Extracting Verb Numbers.
A long tale of woe lies behind the following. Infocom games stored verb numbers
in a single byte in dictionary entries, but they did so counting downwards, so
that verb number 0 was stored as 255, 1 as 254, and so on. Inform followed
suit so that debugging of Inform 1 could be aided by using the then-available
tools for dumping dictionaries from Infocom story files; by using the Infocom
format for dictionary tables, Inform's life was easier.

But there was an implicit restriction there of 255 distinct verbs (not 256
since not all words were verbs). When Glulx raised almost all of the Z-machine
limits, it made space for 65535 verbs instead of 255, but it appears that
nobody remembered to implement this in I6-for-Glulx and the Glulx form of
the I6 library. This was only put right in March 2009, and the following
routine was added to concentrate lookups of this field in one place.

@c
[ DictionaryWordToVerbNum dword verbnum;
#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE;
	verbnum = $ff-(dword->#dict_par2);
#Ifnot; ! GLULX
	dword = dword + #dict_par2 - 1;
    @aloads dword 0 verbnum;
    verbnum = $ffff-verbnum;
#Endif;
	return verbnum;
];

@p Keyboard Primitive.
This is the primitive routine to read from the keyboard: it usually delegates
this to a routine specific to the virtual machine being used, but sometimes
uses a hacked version to allow TEST commands to work. (When a TEST is running,
the text in the walk-through provided is fed into the buffer as if it had
been typed at the keyboard.)

@c
[ KeyboardPrimitive a_buffer a_table;
#Ifdef DEBUG; #Iftrue ({-value:NUMBER_CREATED(test_scenario)} > 0);
	return TestKeyboardPrimitive(a_buffer, a_table);
#Endif; #Endif;
	return VM_ReadKeyboard(a_buffer, a_table);
];

@p Reading the Command.
The |Keyboard| routine actually receives the player's words, putting the
words in |a_buffer| and their dictionary addresses in |a_table|. It is
assumed that the table is the same one on each (standard) call. Much
of the code handles the OOPS and UNDO commands, which are not actions and
do not pass through the rest of the parser. The undo state is saved --
it is essentially an internal saved game, in the VM interpreter's memory
rather than in an external file -- and note that this is therefore also
where execution picks up if an UNDO has been typed. Since UNDO recreates
the former machine state perfectly, it might seem impossible to tell that
an UNDO had occurred, but in fact the VM passes information back in the
form of a return code from the relevant instruction, and this allows us
to detect an undo. (We deal with it by printing the current location and
asking another command.)

|Keyboard| can also be used by miscellaneous routines in the game to ask
yes/no questions and the like, without invoking the rest of the parser.

The return value is the number of words typed.

@c

@p Parser Proper.
The main parser routine is something of a leviathan, and it has traditionally
been divided into 11 lettered parts:

(A) Get the input, do OOPS and AGAIN
(B) Is it a direction, and so an implicit GO?  If so go to (K)
(C) Is anyone being addressed?
(D) Get the command verb: try all the syntax lines for that verb
(E) Break down a syntax line into analysed tokens
(F) Look ahead for advance warning for |multiexcept|/|multiinside|
(G) Parse each token in turn (calling |ParseToken| to do most of the work)
(H) Cheaply parse otherwise unrecognised conversation and return
(I) Print best possible error message
(J) Retry the whole lot
(K) Last thing: check for THEN and further instructions(s), return.

This lettering has been preserved here, with the code under each letter
now being the body of ``Parser Letter A'', ``Parser Letter B'' and so on.

@p Parser Letter H.
Cheaply parse otherwise unrecognised conversation and return.

(Errors are handled differently depending on who was talking. If the command
was addressed to somebody else (eg, DWARF, SFGH) then it is taken as
conversation which the parser has no business in disallowing.)

The parser used to return the fake action |##NotUnderstood| when a
command in the form PERSON, ARFLE BARFLE GLOOP is parsed, where a character
is addressed but with an instruction which the parser can't understand.
(If a command such as ARFLE BARFLE GLOOP is not an instruction to someone
else, the parser prints an error and requires the player to type another
command: thus |##NotUnderstood| was only returned when |actor| is not the
player.) And I6 had elaborate object-oriented ways to deal with this, but we
won't use any of that: we simply convert to a |##Answer| action, which
communicates a snippet of words to another character, just as if the
player had typed ANSWER ARFLE BARFLE GLOOP TO PERSON. For I7 purposes, the
fake action |##NotUnderstood| does not exist.

has happened before or is needed later) and the address of the dictionary
word which makes up the |token|, in the case where it's a ``preposition''.

The return values are:
(a) |GPR_REPARSE| for ``I have rewritten the command, please re-parse from scratch'';
(b) |GPR_PREPOSITION| for ``token accepted with no result'';
(c) $-256 + x$ for ``please parse |ParseToken(ELEMENTARY_TT, x)| instead'';
(d) 0 for ``token accepted, result is the multiple object list'';
(e) 1 for ``token accepted, result is the number in |parsed_number|'';
(f) an object number for ``token accepted with this object as result'';
(g) $-1$ for ``token rejected''.

Strictly speaking |ParseToken| is a shell routine which saves the current
state on the stack, and calling |ParseToken__| to do the actual work.

Once again the routine is traditionally divided into six letters, here named under
paragraphs ``Parse Token Letter A'', and so on.

(A) Analyse the token; handle all tokens not involving object lists and
break down others into elementary tokens
(B) Begin parsing an object list
(C) Parse descriptors (articles, pronouns, etc.) in the list
(D) Parse an object name
(E) Parse connectives (AND, BUT, etc.) and go back to (C)
(F) Return the conclusion of parsing an object list

@p Descriptors.
In grammatical terms, a descriptor appears at the front of an English noun
phrase and clarifies the quantity or specific identity of what is referred
to: for instance, {\it my} mirror, {\it the} dwarf, {\it that} woman.
(Numbers, as in {\it four} duets, are also descriptors in linguistics:
but the I6 parser doesn't handle them that way.)

Slightly unfortunately, the bitmap constants used for descriptors in the
I6 parser have names in the form |*_BIT|, coinciding with the names of
style bits in the list-writer: but they never occur in the same context.

The actual words used as descriptors are read from tables in the language
definition. |ArticleDescriptors| uses this table to move current word
marker past a run of one or more descriptors which refer to the definite
or indefinite article.

@c
Constant OTHER_BIT  =   1;     !  These will be used in Adjudicate()
Constant MY_BIT     =   2;     !  to disambiguate choices
Constant THAT_BIT   =   4;
Constant PLURAL_BIT =   8;
Constant LIT_BIT    =  16;
Constant UNLIT_BIT  =  32;

@p Parsing Descriptors.
The |Descriptors()| routine parses the descriptors at the head of a noun
phrase, leaving the current word marker |wn| at the first word of the
noun phrase's body. It is allowed to set up for a plural only if |allow_p|
is set; it returns a parser error number, or 0 if no error occurred.

@p Noun Domain.
|NounDomain| does the most substantial part of parsing an object name.
It is given two ``domains'' -- usually a location and then the actor who is
looking -- and a context (i.e. token type), and returns:

(a) 0 if no match at all could be made,
(b) 1 if a multiple object was made,
(c) $k$ if object $k$ was the one decided upon,
(d) |REPARSE_CODE| if it asked a question of the player and consequently
rewrote the player's input, so that the whole parser should start again
on the rewritten input.

In case (c), |NounDomain| also sets the variable |length_of_noun| to the
number of words in the input text matched to the noun. In case (b),
the multiple objects are added to |multiple_object| by hand (not by |MultiAdd|,
because we want to allow duplicates).

@p Adjudicate.
The |Adjudicate| routine tries to see if there is an obvious choice, when
faced with a list of objects (the |match_list|) each of which matches the
player's specification equally well. To do this it makes use of the |context|
(the token type being worked on).

It counts up the number of obvious choices for the given context -- all to
do with where a candidate is, except for 6 (|animate|) which is to
do with whether it is animate or not -- and then:

(a) if only one obvious choice is found, that is returned;
(b) if we are in indefinite mode (don't care which) one of the obvious choices
is returned, or if there is no obvious choice then an unobvious one is made;
(c) at this stage, we work out whether the objects are distinguishable from
each other or not: if they are all indistinguishable from each other, then
choose one, it doesn't matter which;
(d) otherwise, 0 (meaning, unable to decide) is returned (but remember
that the equivalence classes we've just worked out will be needed by other
routines to clear up this mess, so we can't economise on working them out).

|Adjudicate| returns $-1$ if an error occurred.

@p Match List.
The match list is an array, |match_list-->|, which holds the current best
guesses at what object(s) a portion of the command refers to. The global
|number_matched| is set to the current length of the |match_list|.

When the parser sees a possible match of object |obj| at quality level |q|,
it calls |MakeMatch(obj, q)|. If this is the best quality match so far, then
we wipe out all the previous matches and start a new list with this one.
If it's only as good as the best so far, we add it to the list (provided
we haven't run out of space, and provided it isn't in the list already).
If it's worse, we ignore it altogether.

I6 tokens in the form |noun=Filter| or |Attribute| are ``noun filter tokens'',
and mean that the match list should be filtered to accept only nouns which
are acceptable to the given routine, or have the given attribute. Such a
token is in force if |token_filter| is used. (I7 makes no use of this in the
attribute case, which is deprecated nowadays.)

Quality is essentially the number of words in the command referring to
the object: the idea is that "red panic button" is better than "red button"
or "panic".

@p Identical.
|Identical| decides whether or not two objects can be distinguished from each
other by anything the player can type. If not, it returns |true|. (This
routine is critical to the handling of plurals, and the list-writer
requires it to be an equivalence relation between objects: but it is,
because it is equivalent to $O_1\sim O_2$ if and only if $f(O_1) = f(O_2)$
for some function $f$.)

@p Print Command.
|PrintCommand| reconstructs the command as it presently reads, from the
pattern which has been built up.

If |from| is 0, it starts with the verb: then it goes through the pattern.

The other parameter is |emptyf| -- a flag: if 0, it goes up to |pcount|:
if 1, it goes up to |pcount|-1.

Note that verbs and prepositions are printed out of the dictionary:
and that since the dictionary may only preserve the first six characters
of a word (in a V3 game), we have to hand-code the longer words needed.
At present, I7 doesn't do this, but it probably should.

(Recall that pattern entries are 0 for ``multiple object'', 1 for ``special
word'', 2 to |REPARSE_CODE-1| are object numbers and |REPARSE_CODE+n| means
the preposition |n|.)

@p CantSee.
The |CantSee| routine returns a good error number for the situation where
the last word looked at didn't seem to refer to any object in context.

The idea is that: if the actor is in a location (but not inside something
like, for instance, a tank which is in that location) then an attempt to
refer to one of the words listed as meaningful-but-irrelevant there
will cause ``you don't need to refer to that in this game'' rather than
``no such thing'' or ``what's `it'?''.

(The advantage of not having looked at ``irrelevant'' local nouns until
now is that it stops them from clogging up the ambiguity-resolving process.
Thus game objects always triumph over scenery.)

@p Multiple Object List.
The |MultiAdd| routine adds object |o| to the multiple-object-list. This is
only allowed to hold |MATCH_LIST_WORDS| minus one objects at most, at which
point it ignores any new entries (and sets a global flag so that a warning
may later be printed if need be).

The |MultiSub| routine deletes object |o| from the multiple-object-list.
It returns 0 if the object was there in the first place, and 9 (because
this is the appropriate error number in |Parser()|) if it wasn't.

The |MultiFilter| routine goes through the multiple-object-list and throws
out anything without the given attribute |attr| set.

@c
[ MultiAdd o i j;
    i = multiple_object-->0;
    if (i == MATCH_LIST_WORDS-1) { toomany_flag = 1; rtrue; }

    }
];

@p Scope.
The scope of an actor is the set of objects which he can refer to in typed
commands, which is normally the same as the set of visible objects; but this
can be modified. This is how I7 handles tokens like ``[any room]''.

Scope determination is done by calling |SearchScope| to iterate through the
objects in scope, and ``visit'' each one: which means, carry out some task
for each as we get there. The task depends on the current value of
|scope_reason|, which is |PARSING_REASON| when the parser is matching
command text against object names.

The scope machinery is built on a number of levels, each making use only
of lower levels:
(0) Either |NounDomain|, |TestScope| or |LoopOverScope| makes one or more
calls to |SearchScope| (on level 1). The point of making multiple calls
is to influence the order in which items in scope are visited, which improves
the quality of ``take all''-style multiple object lists, for instance.
(1) |SearchScope| searches for the objects in scope which are within first
one domain, and then another: for instance, first within the current room
but not within the current actor, and then within the current actor. It can
be called either from level 0, or externally from the choose-objects
machinery, but is not recursive. It works within the context of a given
token in the parser (when called for |PARSING_REASON|) and in particular
the |multiinside| token, and also handles testing commands, scope tokens,
scope in darkness, and intervention by the I7 ``deciding the scope of''
activity. Most of its actual searches are delegated to |ScopeWithin| (level
2), but it also uses |DoScopeActionAndRecurse| (level 3) and
|DoScopeAction| (level 4) as necessary.
(2) |ScopeWithin| iterates through the objects in scope which are within
one supplied domain, but not within another. It can be called either
from level 1, or independently from rules in the ``deciding the scope of''
activity via the I7 ``place the contents of X in scope'' phrase. It calls
|DoScopeActionAndRecurse| (level 3) on any unconcealed objects it finds.
(3) |DoScopeActionAndRecurse| visits a given object by calling down to
|DoScopeAction| (level 4), and recurses to all unconcealed object-tree
contents and component parts of the object. The I7 phrase ``place X in
scope'' uses this routine.
(4) |DoScopeAction| simply visits a single object, taking whatever action
is needed there -- which will depend on the |scope_reason|. The only use
made by the parser of |TryGivenObject|, which tries to match command text
against the name of a given object, is from here. The I7 phrase ``place X
in scope, but not its contents'' uses this routine.

Two routines are provided for code external to the parser to modify the
scope. They should be called only during scope deliberations -- i.e., 
in |scope=...| tokens or in rules for the ``deciding the scope of''
activity. (At present, |AddToScope| is not used in I7 at all.) Note
that this I7 form of |PlaceInScope| has a slightly different specification
to its I6 library counterpart of the same name: it can place a room in
scope. (In I6, room names were not normally parsed.)

@c
[ PlaceInScope O opts; ! If opts is set, do not place contents in scope
	wn = match_from;
	if (opts == false) DoScopeActionAndRecurse(O);
	else DoScopeAction(O);
	return;
];

[ AddToScope obj;
    if (ats_flag >= 2) DoScopeActionAndRecurse(obj, 0, ats_flag-2);
    if (ats_flag == 1) { if (HasLightSource(obj)==1) ats_hls = 1; }
];

@p Scope Level 0.
The two ways of starting up the scope machinery other than via the parser
code above.

@c
[ TestScope obj act a al sr x y;
    x = parser_one; y = parser_two;
    parser_one = obj; parser_two = 0; a = actor; al = actors_location;
    sr = scope_reason; scope_reason = TESTSCOPE_REASON;
    if (act == 0) actor = player; else actor = act;
    actors_location = ScopeCeiling(actor);
    SearchScope(actors_location, actor, 0); scope_reason = sr; actor = a;
    actors_location = al; parser_one = x; x = parser_two; parser_two = y;
    return x;
];

[ LoopOverScope routine act x y a al;
    x = parser_one; y = scope_reason; a = actor; al = actors_location;
    parser_one = routine;
    if (act == 0) actor = player; else actor = act;
    actors_location = ScopeCeiling(actor);
    scope_reason = LOOPOVERSCOPE_REASON;
    SearchScope(actors_location, actor, 0);
    parser_one = x; scope_reason = y; actor = a; actors_location = al;
];

@p SearchScope.
Level 1. The method is:
(a) If the context is a |scope=...| token, then the search is delegated
to ``stage 2'' of the scope routine. This was the old I6 way to override
the searching behaviour: while users probably won't be using it any more,
the template does, in order to give testing commands universal scope which
is exempt from the activity below; and the NI compiler creates |scope=...|
tokens to handle Understand grammar such as ``[any room]''. So the feature
remains very much still in use.
(b) The ``deciding the scope of'' activity is given the chance to intervene.
This is the I7 way to override the searching behaviour, and is the one taken
by users.
(c) And otherwise:
(-1) The I6 |multiinside| token, used as the first noun of its grammar line,
has as its scope all of the objects which are inside or on top of the
{\it second} noun of the grammar line. This provides a neat scope for the
ALL in a command like GET ALL FROM CUPBOARD, where the player clearly
does not intend ALL to refer to the cupboard itself, for instance. The
difficulty is that we don't yet know what the second object is, if we are
parsing left to right. But the parser code above has taken care of all of
that, and the |advance_warning| global is set to the object number of the
second noun, or to $-1$ if that is not yet known. Note that we check that
the contents are visible before adding them to scope, because otherwise
an unscrupulous player could use such a command to detect the contents of
an opaque locked box. If this rule applies, we skip (c.2), (c.3) and (c.4).
(-2) For all other tokens except |creature|, searching scope for the room
holding the current actor always catches the compass directions unless a
definite article has already been typed. (Thus OPEN THE EAST would match
an object called ``east door'', but not the compass direction ``east''.)
(-3) The contents of |domain1| which are not contents of |domain2| are
placed in scope, and so are any component parts of |domain1|. If |domain1|
is a container or supporter, it is placed in scope itself.
(-4) The contents and component parts of |domain2| are placed in scope.
If |domain2| is a container or supporter, it is placed in scope itself.
(-5) In darkness, the actor and his component parts are in scope. If the
actor is inside or on top of something, then that thing is also in scope.
(This avoids a situation where the player gets into an opaque box, then
pulls it closed from the inside, plunging himself into darkness, then types
OPEN BOX only to be told that he can't see any such thing.)

@p ScopeWithin.
Level 2. |ScopeWithin| puts objects visible from within the |domain| into scope.
An item belonging to the |domain| is placed in scope unless it is being
concealed by the |domain|: and even then, if the |domain| is the current
actor. Suppose Zorro conceals a book beneath his cloak: then the book is
not in scope to his lady friend The Black Whip, but it is in scope to Zorro
himself. (Thus an actor is not allowed to conceal anything from himself.)

Note that the |domain| object itself, and its component parts if any, are
not placed in scope by this routine, though nothing prevents some other
code doing so.

@c

@p DoScopeActionAndRecurse.
Level 3.
In all cases, the |domain| itself is visited. There are then three possible
forms of recursion:
(a) To unconcealed objects which are inside, on top of, carried or worn by
the |domain|: this is called ``searching'' in traditional I6 language and
is suppressed if |domain| is the special value |nosearch|.
(b) To unconcealed component parts of the |domain|.
(c) To any other objects listed in the |add_to_scope| property array, or
supplied by the |add_to_scope| property routine, if it has one. (I7 does
not usually use |add_to_scope|, but it remains a useful hook in the parser,
so it retains its old I6 library interpretation.)

@p Parsing Object Names.
We now reach the final major block of code in the parser: the part which tries
to match a given object's name(s) against the text at word position |match_from|
in the player's command, and calls |MakeMatch| if it succeeds. There are
basically four possibilities: ME, a pronoun such as IT, a name which doesn't
begin misleadingly with a number, and a name which does. In the latter two
cases, we pass the job down to |TryGivenObject|.

@c
[ MatchTextAgainstObject item i;
	if (match_from <= num_words) { ! If there's any text to match, that is
		wn = match_from;
		i = NounWord();
		if ((i == 1) && (player == item)) MakeMatch(item, 1); ! "me"
		if ((i >= 2) && (i < 128) && (LanguagePronouns-->i == item)) MakeMatch(item, 1);
	}

	! Construing the current word as the start of a noun, can it refer to the
	! object?

	wn = match_from;
	if (TryGivenObject(item) > 0)
		if (indef_nspec_at > 0 && match_from ~= indef_nspec_at) {
			! This case arises if the player has typed a number in
			! which is hypothetically an indefinite descriptor:
			! e.g. "take two clubs".  We have just checked the object
			! against the word "clubs", in the hope of eventually finding
			! two such objects.  But we also backtrack and check it
			! against the words "two clubs", in case it turns out to
			! be the 2 of Clubs from a pack of cards, say.  If it does
			! match against "two clubs", we tear up our original
			! assumption about the meaning of "two" and lapse back into
			! definite mode.

			wn = indef_nspec_at;
			if (TryGivenObject(item) > 0) {
				match_from = indef_nspec_at;
				ResetDescriptors();
			}
			wn = match_from;
		}
];

@p TryGivenObject.
|TryGivenObject| tries to match as many words as possible in what has been
typed to the given object, |obj|. If it manages any words matched at all,
it calls |MakeMatch| to say so, then returns the number of words (or 1
if it was a match because of inadequate input).

@p Refers.
|Refers| works out whether the word at number wnum can refer to the object
|obj|, returning true or false.  The standard method is to see if the word
is listed under the |name| property for the object, but this is more
complex in languages other than English.

@c

@p NounWord.
|NounWord| (which takes no arguments) returns:
(a) 0 if the next word is not in the dictionary or is but does not carry the
``noun'' bit in its dictionary entry,
(b) 1 if it is a word meaning ``me'',
(c) the index in the pronoun table (plus 2) of the value field of a pronoun,
if it is a pronoun,
(d) the address in the dictionary if it is a recognised noun.

@c

    if ((i->#dict_par1)&128 == 0) rfalse;
    return i;
];

@p TryNumber.
|TryNumber| takes word number |wordnum| and tries to parse it as an (unsigned)
decimal number or the name of a small number, returning

(a) $-1000$ if it is not a number
(b) the number, if it has between 1 and 4 digits
(c) 10000 if it has 5 or more digits.

(The danger of allowing 5 digits is that Z-machine integers are only 16 bits
long, and anyway this routine isn't meant to be perfect: it only really needs
to be good enough to handle numeric descriptors such as those in TAKE 31 COINS
or DROP FOUR DAGGERS. In particular, it is not the way I7 ``[number]'' tokens
are parsed.)

@p Choose Objects.
This material, the final body of code in the parser, is an I7 addition.
The I6 parser leaves it to the user to provide a |ChooseObjects| routine
to decide between possibilities when the situation is ambiguous. For I7
use, we provide a |ChooseObjects| which essentially runs the ``does the
player mean'' rulebook to decide, though this is not obvious from the
code below because it is hidden in the |CheckDPMR| routine -- which
is defined in the Standard Rules, not here.

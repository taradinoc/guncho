B/figst: Figures Template.
 
@Purpose: To display figures and play sound effects.

@p Resource Usage.
We record whether pictures or sounds have been used before by storing
single byte flags in the following array. (The extra 5 values allow for the
fact that it can be legal to use low undeclared sound effect resource
numbers in the Z-machine for short beeps, though this is deprecated in I7.)

Pictures and sounds are identified within blorb archives by resource ID
numbers which count upwards from 1 in order of creation, but can mix
pictures and sounds freely. (For instance, 1 might be a picture, 2 and 3
sound effects, then 4 a picture again, etc.) ID number 1 is in fact always
a picture: it means the cover art, and is the I6 representation of the
value ``figure of cover''.

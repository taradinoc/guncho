B/outt: Output Template.
 
@Purpose: This is the superstructure of the file of I6 code output by NI:
from ICL commands at the top down to the signing-off comments at the bottom.
 
@-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@p ICL Commands.
The Inform Control Language is a mini-language for controlling the I6 compiler,
able to set command-line switches, memory settings and so on. I6 ordinarily
discards lines beginning with exclamation marks as comments, but at the very
top of the file, lines beginning |!%| are read as ICL commands: as soon as
any line (including a blank line) doesn't have this signature, I6 exits
ICL mode. So, basically, we'd better do this here:

@c
{-call:compile_icl_commands}

@p Other Configuration.
Setting the |Grammar__Version| constant is a rather creaky old way to tell
the I6 compiler to use more detailed grammar tables: GV1 has not in fact
been used since about 1994.

@c
Constant Grammar__Version 2;

@p Identification.
Both of the compiler and template layer, and of the story file to be produced.

The ``library'' identifying texts are now a little anachronistic, since the
template layer is not strictly speaking an I6 library in the same way as
the original: but it is surely the spiritual successor to 6/11N, so we
may as well mark it 6/12N.

@c
! This file was compiled by Inform 7: the build number and version of the
! I6 template layer used are as follows.
{-call:compile_build_number}
Constant LibSerial = "080126";
Constant LibRelease = "6/12N";
Constant LIBRARY_VERSION = 612;

{-array:UUID_ARRAY}
{-call:compile_bibliographic_i6_constants}
Default Story 0;
Default Headline 0;

{-routine:ShowExtensionVersions}

@p Use options.
Use options are translated into I6 constant declarations, and NI puts them
here:

@c
{-call:compile_use_options}

@p Constants.

@c
{-segment:Definitions.i6t}

@p Global Variables.
These are not the only global variables defined in the template layer:
those needed locally only by single sections (and not used in definitions
of phrases in the Standard Rules, or referred to by NI directly) are defined
within those sections -- they can be regarded as unimportant implementation
details, subject to change at whim. The variables here, on the other hand,
are more important to understand.

(1) The first three variables to be defined are special in that they are
significant to very early-style Z-machine interpreters, where they are
used to produce the status line display (hence |sline1| and |sline2|).
The first variable must always equal a valid object number, which is why
we -- pretty weirdly -- set it equal to the placeholder object |InformLibrary|,
which takes no part in play, and is not a valid I7 object. This is not
typesafe in I7 terms, but that doesn't matter because initialisation
will correct it to a typesafe value before any I7 source text can execute.
(|sline1| and |sline2| are entirely unused on when we target Glulx.)
Once these variables are defined, the sequence of definition of the rest
is not significant.

(2) The |say__*| are used for the finite state machine used in printing
text, which keeps track of automatic paragraph breaking and the like. For
details see the ``Printing.i6t'' section. For |subst__v|, see the
explanation of ``substitution-variable'' in the Standard Rules. The
variables |ct_0| and |ct_1| hold the current choice of table and table row,
respectively, but in some ways these global variables are misleading: in
very many routines, |ct_0| and |ct_1| are defined as local variables, and
it's the local definitions which take precedence. (The global variables
allow table-selecting code to compile in routines where it isn't possible
to define these locals because no stack frame exists.)

(3) |standard_interpreter| is used only for the Z-machine VM, and is always
0 for Glulx. For Z, a non-zero value here is the version number of the
{\it Z-Machine Standards Document} which the interpreter claims to support,
in the form (upper byte).(lower). |undo_flag|, similarly, behaves slightly
differently on the two platforms according to whether they support multiple
consecutive UNDOs. UNDO basically works by taking memory snapshots of the
whole VM (``saving UNDO'') to revert to at a later point (``performing UNDO''),
so it is expensive on memory, and traditional VMs can only store a single
memory snapshot -- making two UNDOs in a row, going back two steps,
impossible. Given this, |undo_flag| has three possible states: 0 means
UNDO is not available at all, 1 means it is not available now because
there is no further saved state to go back to from here, and 2 means it
is available.

(4) |deadflag| in normally 0, or false, meaning play continues; 1 means the
game ended in death; 2 for ended in victory; higher numbers represent exotic
endings. |deadflag| switching state normally triggers an end to rulebook
processing, so is the single most important global variable to the running
of a story file.

(5) At present, |time_rate| is not made use of in I7: if positive, it is
the number of minutes which pass each turn; if negative, the number of
turns which pass each minute. This is quite a neat way to approximate a
wide range of time steps with an integer such that fractions are exact
and we can approximate any duration to a fair accuracy (the worst case
being $3/4$ minute, where we have to choose between 1 minute or $1/2$
minute).

(6) Note that |notify_mode| is irrelevant if the use option ``Use no scoring''
is in force: it isn't looked at, and can't be changed, and shouldn't have
an effect anyway since |score| will never be altered.

(7) |player| is a variable, not a constant, since the focus of play can
change. |SACK_OBJECT| is likewise an unexpected variable: in the I6
library, there could only be one player's holdall, a single rucksack-like
possession which had to be the value of the constant |SACK_OBJECT|. Here we
define |SACK_OBJECT| as a global variable instead, the value of which is
the player's holdall currently in use. |visibility_ceiling| is the
highest object in the tree visible from the player's point of view:
usually the room, but sometimes nothing (in darkness), and sometimes a
closed non-transparent container.

(8) See ``OrderOfPlay.i6t'' for the meaning of action variables.

(9) This is a slate of global variables used by the parser to give some
context to the general parsing routines (GPRs) which it calls; in the I6
design, any object can provide its own GPR, in the form of a |parse_name|
property. GPRs are in effect parser plug-ins, and I7 makes extensive use
of them.

(10) Similarly, variables for the parser to give context to another sort
of plug-in routine: a scope filter. I7 uses these too.

(11) The |move_*| variables are specific to the |##Going| action.

(12) These variables hold current settings for listing objects and,
more elaborately, performing room descriptions.

(13) The current colour scheme is stored in variables in order that it can
be saved in the save game state, and changed correctly on an UNDO: if it
were a transient state inside the VM interpreter's screen model, then a
RESTORE or UNDO will upset what the original author may have intended the
appearance of text in particular scenes to be. (Cf. Adam Cadre's I6 patch
|L61007|.)

(14) These pixel dimensions are used both for the Glulx and v6 Z-machines,
but not for the more commonly used versions 5 or 8, whose screen model is
based on character cells.

(15) Parameters used by |LibraryMessages|: this may be replaced later.

(16) For debugging. |debug_flag| is traditionally called so, but is actually
now a bitmap of flags for tracing actions, calls to object routines, and so on.

@p VM-Specific Code.
These sections of code contain different definitions of the same routines,
and in some cases the same arrays, to handle low-level functions in the
virtual machine -- saving the game, performing UNDO, parsing typed text into
dictionary word addresses and so on.

@c
#Ifdef TARGET_GLULX;
{-segment:Glulx.i6t}
#Endif;

#Ifdef TARGET_ZCODE;
{-segment:ZMachine.i6t}
#Endif;

@p Compass.
I6 identified compass directions as being children of the pseudo-object
|Compass|; I7 uses membership of the class |CompassDirection| instead.
We need both ways here. (Note that |Compass| is not a valid I7 object,
and is used for no other purpose.) Because of the traditional structure
of language definitions, this needs to come first.

@c
Class CompassDirection
 with capacity 0, article "the", description [; L__M(##Look, 7, self); ],
  has scenery;

Object Compass "compass" has concealed;

@p Language of Play.
The equivalent of I6's language definition file, though here the idea is
that a translation should have an inclusion to replace the ``Language.i6t''
segment, which contains the English definition.

@c
{-segment:Language.i6t}

Default LanguageCases 1;
#Ifndef LibraryMessages; Object LibraryMessages; #Endif;

@p The Old Library.
The I6 library consisted essentially of the parser, the verb routines, and
a pile of utilities and world-modelling code, of which the biggest single
component was the list-writer. The parser lives on below; the verb routines
are gone, with the equivalent functionality having moved upstairs into
I7 source text in the Standard Rules; and the rest of the library largely
lives here:

@c
{-segment:Light.i6t}
{-segment:ListWriter.i6t}
{-segment:Utilities.i6t}

@p Parser.
The largest single block of code in the traditional I6 library part of the
template layer is the parser.

The two pseudo-objects |InformParser| and |InformLibrary| are relics of the
object-oriented approach in I6, and are used only very slightly in the
template layer; they are not used at all in I7, and are not valid for the
``object'' kind of value.

The parser includes arrays for typed text and some parsing information
derived from it, and if these should overrun it would cause enigmatic
bugs, as the next arrays in memory would be corrupted: as a tripwire,
the |Protect_I7_Arrays| array consists of two magic values in sequence.
If it is ever discovered to contain the wrong data, the alarm sounds.

@c
Object InformParser "(Inform Parser)" has proper;

{-segment:Parser.i6t}

[ ParserError error_type;
	if (error_type ofclass String or Routine) PrintSingleParagraph(error_type);
	rfalse;
];

Object InformLibrary "(Inform Library)" has proper;

Array Protect_I7_Arrays --> 16339 12345;

@p Order of Play.
The |Main| routine, where execution begins, and the primitive rules in the
principal rulebooks.

@c
{-segment:OrderOfPlay.i6t}

@p Properties.
Some either/or properties are compiled to I6 attributes, which must be
predeclared, so we do that first. (All other properties can simply be
used without declaration.)

What then follows is a table of property metadata: in particular, specifying
which properties can be used with which I6 classes or objects. Policing
this at run-time costs a little speed, but traps many errors of programming,
and keeps everything typesafe. It is the price we pay for the relatively
lenient compile-time checking of I7's ``object'' kind of value. To make
it as efficient as possible, we calculate offsets into the metadata: this
has to be done (once) at run-time, with the routine compiled.

@c
{-call:compile_attributes}

{-array:property_metadata}
Array attribute_offsets --> (50 + {-value:NUMBER_CREATED(property_name)});
Array property_offsets --> (100 + {-value:NUMBER_CREATED(property_name)} + INDIV_PROP_START-48);

{-routine:CreatePropertyOffsets}

@p Quantities.
Some of these are constants -- the enumerated values of new kinds of value
with names as values -- while others are non-local variables in I7. NI
can choose to translate an I7 variable into any I6 lvalue, and usually
makes this an entry in an array called |Global_Vars| rather than an I6
global variable: the latter are limited in number, the former are not.

@c
{-call:declare_quantities}
{-array:Global_Vars}

@p Activities.
These are numbered upwards from 0 in order of creation. The following arrays
taken together provide, for each activity number: (i) the rulebook numbers
for the before, for, and after stages of the activity, and (ii) a flag
indicating whether the activity is ``future action''-capable, that is, is
a parsing activity allowed to make use of the action which conjecturally
might result from the current grammar line being parsed. (This is called
the ``action to be'', hence ``atb''.)

@c
Constant NUMBER_RULEBOOKS_CREATED = {-value:NUMBER_CREATED(rulebook)};
{-call:compile_activity_constants}
{-array:Activity_before_rulebooks}

@p Printing Routines.

@c
{-call:compile_data_type_support_routines}
{-routine:I7_Kind_Name}
{-routine:RulebookOutcomePrintingRule}

@p Object Tree.
The I6 object tree contains |Class| definitions as well as objects, but
we precede both with a pseudo-object called |property_numberspace_forcer|.
It does nothing except to ensure that properties are declared in I6 in the
same sequence as I7 (which need not otherwise happen); it plays no part
in play, and is not a valid I7 ``object'' value.

@c

``Tables.i6t'' for details.

@c
{-log:Compiling the tables}
{-call:compile_tables}

@p Equations.

{-call:compile_action_routines}
{-routine:MistakeActionSub}

@p Phrases.
The following innocent-looking commands tell NI to compile I6 definitions
for all of the non-inline ``To...'' phrases, and all of the rules which
are not I6-written primitives, so it results in a fairly enormous cataract
of code.

@c
{-log:Compiling the phrases}
{-call:compile_phrases}
{-call:compile_adjectival_phrases}
{-call:compile_list_together_routines}
{-call:compile_los_routines}

@p Timed Events.
Some of the phrases are simply called in the course of other phrases, but
some are rules in rulebooks or in the table of timed events, so those
come next:

@c
{-array:TimedEventsTable}
{-array:TimedEventTimesTable}

@p Rulebooks.
The literally hundreds of rulebooks are set up here. (In the end a rulebook
is only a (word) array of rule addresses, terminated with a |NULL|.)

@c

grammar lines as yet.

#ENDIF; ! DEBUG

@p I6 Inclusions.
This paragraph contains no code, by default: it's a hook on which to hang
verbatim I6 material.

@c
! "Include (- ... -)" inclusions with no specified position appear here.

@p Entries in constant lists.
Well: most of them, anyway. In particular, all of those which are lists of
texts with substitution will be swept up, which is important for timing
reasons. A second round later on will catch any later ones.

@c
{-call:compile_list_constants}

@p Text Substitutions.
We now have to be quite careful about the sequence of events. Compiling the
text routines is an irrevocable step, after which we must not compile any
new text with substitutions. On the other hand we mustn't leave it any later,
because a text substitution might contain references to the past, or involve
propositions which must be deferred into routines.

@c
{-log-phase:Winding up}
{-log:Compiling routines to print text containing substitutions}
{-call:compile_text_routines}
{-callv:allow_no_further_text_subs}

@p Chronology.
Similarly, this is where we wrap up all references to past tenses: after this
point, we cannot safely compile any I7 condition in the past tense.

@c
{-log:Compiling chronology}
{-segment:Chronology.i6t}
{-callv:allow_no_further_past_tenses}

@p Grammar.
This is the trickiest matter of timing. We had to leave the grammar lines
until now because the past-tense code above might have needed to investigate
whether the player's command matched a given pattern at some time in the
past (a case which arose naturally in one of the example games, so which
should not be dismissed as an aberration). This is therefore the earliest
point at which we can know for sure that no further grammar lines are
needed.

@c
{-log:Compiling I6 Verb directives}
{-call:compile_grammar_verbs}

#IFTRUE ({-value:no_verb_verb_defined} == 1);
[ UnknownVerb; verb_wordnum = 0; return 'no.verb'; ];
[ PrintVerb v;
	if (v == 'no.verb') { print "do something to"; rtrue; }
	rfalse;
];
#Ifnot;
[ UnknownVerb; rfalse; ]; [ PrintVerb v; rfalse; ];
#ENDIF;

@p Deferred Propositions.
Most conditions, such as ``the score is 10'', and descriptions, such as
``open doors which are in lighted rooms'', are translated by NI into
propositions in a form of predicate calculus. Sometimes these can be
compiled immediately to I6 code, but other times they involve complicated
searches and have to be ``deferred'' into special routines which will
perform them. This is where we compile those routines.

@c
{-log:Compiling routines from predicate calculus}
{-call:compile_deferred_propositions}
{-callv:allow_no_further_deferrals}

@p Miscellaneous Loose Ends.
And we still aren't done, because we still have:

(1) Routines which switch between possible interpretations of phrases
by performing run-time type checking. (Note that these cannot involve
grammar, or the past tenses, or text substitutions, or deferred propositions.)

(2) Arrays holding constant lists, such as |{2, 3, 4}|, if any.

(3) The string constants, named in the pattern |SC_*|, in alphabetical order.
(This ensures that their packed addresses will have unsigned comparison
ordering equivalent to alphabetical order.)

(4) ``Stub'' I6 constants for property names where properties aren't used,
to prevent them causing errors if they are referred to in code but not
actually present in any object (as can easily happen with extensions
presenting optional features which the user chooses not to employ).
|cap_short_name| is similarly stubbed: this doesn't correspond to any
I7 property, but is used by NI to record capitalised forms of the printed
name (which in turn goes into |short_name|).

(5) Counters are used to allocate cells of storage to inline phrases which
need a permanent state associated with them: see the Standard Rules. Since
all I7 source text has been compiled by now, we know the final values of
the counters, and therefore the amount of storage we need to allocate.

(6) Similarly, each ``quotation'' box needs its own cell of memory.

@c
{-call:compile_resolver_routines}
{-call:compile_list_constants}
{-array:ConstantListPointers}
{-call:compile_string_constants}
{-call:compile_stub_properties}
#IFNDEF cap_short_name;
Constant cap_short_name = short_name;
#ENDIF;
{-call:compile_allocated_counter_storage}
Array Runtime_Quotations_Displayed --> {-value:extent_of_runtime_quotations_array};

@p Block Values.
These are values which are pointers to more elaborate data on the memory heap,
rather than values in themselves: they point to ``blocks''. A section of code
handles the heap, and there is then one further section to support each of
the kinds of value in question.

@c
{-call:compile_heap_allocator}

{-segment:Flex.i6t}
{-segment:BlockValues.i6t}
{-segment:IndexedText.i6t}
{-segment:RegExp.i6t}
{-segment:StoredAction.i6t}
{-segment:Lists.i6t}

@p Signing off.
And that's all, folks.

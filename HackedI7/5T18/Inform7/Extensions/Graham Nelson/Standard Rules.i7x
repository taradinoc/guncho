Part SR4 - Actions

Section SR4/1 - Generic action patterns

Section SR4/2 - Actions concerning the actor's possessions

Taking inventory is an action with past participle taken, applying to nothing.
The taking inventory action translates into I6 as "Inv".

The specification of the taking inventory action is "Taking an inventory of
one's immediate possessions: the things being carried, either directly or in
any containers being carried. When the player performs this action, either
the inventory listing, or else a special message if nothing is being carried
or worn, is printed during the carry out rules: nothing happens at the report
stage. The opposite happens for other people performing the action: nothing
happens during carry out, but a report such as 'Mr X looks through his
possessions.' is produced (provided Mr X is visible).

The exotic 'use inventory to set pronouns rule' allows the inventory
listing to change the current meanings of IT, HIM, HER, and so on for the
player's future commands. Thus if the player is carrying a certain female
cat, say, taking inventory might print up the name 'Missee Lee', and this
would set HER to refer to Missee Lee. Some IF authors dislike this
convention: it can be abolished by writing 'The use inventory to set
pronouns rule is not listed in any rulebook.'"

Carry out taking inventory (this is the print empty inventory rule):
	if the first thing held by the player is nothing, stop the action with
		library message taking inventory action number 1.

Carry out taking inventory (this is the print standard inventory rule):
	issue library message taking inventory action number 2;
	say ":[line break]";
	list the contents of the player, with newlines, indented, including contents,
		giving inventory information, with extra indentation.

Carry out taking inventory (this is the use inventory to set pronouns rule):
	set pronouns from possessions of the player.

Report an actor taking inventory (this is the report other people taking
	inventory rule):
	if the actor is not the player,
		issue actor-based library message taking inventory action number 5 for the actor.

Taking is an action with past participle taken, applying to one thing.
The taking action translates into I6 as "Take".

The specification of the taking action is "The taking action is the only way
an action in the Standard Rules can cause something to be carried by an actor.
It is very simple in operation (the entire carry out stage consists only of
'now the actor carries the noun') but many checks must be performed before it
can be allowed to happen."

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take yourself rule):
	if the actor is the noun, stop the action with library message taking
		action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take other people rule):
	if the noun is a person, stop the action with library message taking
		action number 3 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take component parts rule):
	if the noun is part of something (called the whole), stop the action
		with library message taking action number 7 for the whole.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take people's possessions rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	let H be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;
	while H is not nothing and H is not the local ceiling:
		if H is a person, stop the action with library message taking action
			number 6 for H;
		let H be the not-counting-parts holder of H;

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take items out of play rule):
	let H be the noun;
	while H is not nothing and H is not a room:
		let H be the not-counting-parts holder of H;
	if H is nothing, stop the action with library message taking action
		number 8 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take what you're inside rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	if the local ceiling is the noun, stop the action with library message
		taking action number 4 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take what's already taken rule):
	if the actor is carrying the noun, stop the action with library message
		taking action number 5 for the noun;
	if the actor is wearing the noun, stop the action with library message
		taking action number 5 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take scenery rule):
	if the noun is scenery, stop the action with library message taking
		action number 10 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can only take things rule):
	if the noun is not a thing, stop the action with library message taking
		action number 15 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the can't take what's fixed in place rule):
	if the noun is fixed in place, stop the action with library message taking
		action number 11 for the noun.

Check an actor taking (this is the use player's holdall to avoid exceeding
	carrying capacity rule):
	if the number of things carried by the actor is at least the
		carrying capacity of the actor:
		if the actor is holding a player's holdall (called the sack):
			let the transferred item be nothing;
			repeat with the possible item running through things carried by
				the actor:
				if the possible item is not lit and the possible item is not
					the sack, let the transferred item be the possible item;
			if the transferred item is not nothing:
				issue library message taking action number 13 for the
					transferred item;
				silently try the actor trying inserting the transferred item
					into the sack;
				if the transferred item is not in the sack, stop the action;

Check an actor taking (this is the can't exceed carrying capacity rule):
	if the number of things carried by the actor is at least the
		carrying capacity of the actor, stop the action with library
		message taking action number 12 for the actor.

Carry out an actor taking (this is the standard taking rule):
	now the actor carries the noun.

Report an actor taking (this is the standard report taking rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message taking action number 1
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message taking action number 16 for the noun.

Removing it from is an action applying to two things.
The removing it from action translates into I6 as "Remove".

The specification of the removing it from action is "Removing is not really
an action in its own right. Whereas there are many ways to put something down
(on the floor, on top of something, inside something else, giving it to
somebody else, and so on), Inform has only one way to take something: the
taking action. Removing exists only to provide some nicely worded replies
to impossible requests, and in all sensible cases is converted into taking.
Because of this, it's usually a bad idea to write rules about removing:
if you write a rule such as 'Instead of removing the key, ...' then it
won't apply if the player simply types TAKE KEY instead. The safe way to
do this is to write a rule about taking, which covers all possibilities."

Check an actor removing something from (this is the can't remove what's not inside rule):
	if the holder of the noun is not the second noun, stop the action with
		library message removing it from action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor removing something from (this is the can't remove from people rule):
	if the holder of the noun is a person (called the owner), stop the action with
		library message taking action number 6 for the owner.

Check an actor removing something from (this is the convert remove to take rule):
	convert to the taking action on the noun.

The can't take component parts rule is listed before the can't remove what's not
inside rule in the check removing it from rules.

Dropping is an action applying to one thing.
The dropping action translates into I6 as "Drop".

The specification of the dropping action is "Dropping is one of five actions
by which an actor can get rid of something carried: the others are inserting
(into a container), putting (onto a supporter), giving (to someone else) and
eating. Dropping means dropping onto the actor's current floor, which is
usually the floor of a room - but might be the inside of a box if the actor
is also inside that box, and so on.

The can't drop clothes being worn rule silently tries the taking off action
on any clothing being dropped: unlisting this rule removes both this behaviour
and also the requirement that clothes cannot simply be dropped."

Check an actor dropping (this is the can't drop yourself rule):
	if the noun is the actor, stop the action with library message putting
		it on action number 4.

Check an actor dropping (this is the can't drop what's already dropped rule):
	if the noun is in the holder of the actor, stop the action with library
		message dropping action number 1 for the noun.

	if the actor is carrying the noun, continue the action;
	if the actor is wearing the noun, continue the action;
	stop the action with library message dropping action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor dropping (this is the can't drop clothes being worn rule):

Check an actor dropping (this is the can't drop if this exceeds carrying
	capacity rule):
	let H be the holder of the actor;
	if H is a room, continue the action; [room floors have infinite capacity]
	if H provides the property carrying capacity:
		if H is a supporter:
			if the number of things on H is at least the carrying capacity of H:
				if the actor is the player,
					issue library message dropping action number 5 for H;
				stop the action;
		otherwise if H is a container:
			if the number of things in H is at least the carrying capacity of H:
				if the actor is the player,
					issue library message dropping action number 6 for H;
				stop the action;

Carry out an actor dropping (this is the standard dropping rule):
	now the noun is in the holder of the actor.

Report an actor dropping (this is the standard report dropping rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message dropping action number 4
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message dropping action number 7 for the noun.

Putting it on is an action with past participle put, applying to two things.

	let the noun-CPC be the component parts core of the noun;
	let the second-CPC be the component parts core of the second noun;

	if the transfer ceiling is the noun-CPC,
		stop the action with library message putting it on action number 2 for
			the noun.

Check an actor putting something on (this is the can't put onto what's not a supporter rule):
	if the second noun is not a supporter,
		stop the action with library message putting it on action number 3 for
			the second noun.

	if the actor encloses the second noun,
		stop the action with library message putting it on action number 4 for
			the second noun.

Check an actor putting something on (this is the can't put clothes being worn rule):
	if the actor is wearing the noun:
		issue library message putting it on action number 5 for the noun;
		silently try the actor trying taking off the noun;
		if the actor is wearing the noun, stop the action;

Check an actor putting something on (this is the can't put if this exceeds
	carrying capacity rule):
	if the second noun provides the property carrying capacity:
		if the number of things on the second noun is at least the carrying capacity
			of the second noun,
			stop the action with library message putting it on action number 6 for
			the second noun;

Carry out an actor putting something on (this is the standard putting rule):
	now the noun is on the second noun.

Report an actor putting something on (this is the concise report putting rule):

		stop the action with library message putting it on action number 7
		for the noun;
	otherwise continue the action.

Report an actor putting something on (this is the standard report putting rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message putting it on action
		number 8 for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message putting it on action
		number 9 for the noun.

Inserting it into is an action applying to two things.
The inserting it into action translates into I6 as "Insert".

The specification of the inserting it into action is "By this action, an actor puts
something he is holding into a container: for instance, putting a coin into a
collection box."

Check an actor inserting something into (this is the convert insert to drop where
	possible rule):
	if the second noun is down or the actor is in the second noun,
		convert to the dropping action on the noun.

		the noun.

Check an actor inserting something into (this is the can't insert something into itself rule):
	let the noun-CPC be the component parts core of the noun;

			stop the action with library message inserting it into action number 7 for
				the second noun;

Carry out an actor inserting something into (this is the standard inserting rule):
	now the noun is in the second noun.

		number 9 for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message inserting it into action number 10 for the noun.

Eating is an action with past participle eaten, applying to one carried thing.
The eating action translates into I6 as "Eat".

The specification of the eating action is "Eating is the only one of the
built-in actions which can, in effect, destroy something: the carry out
rule removes what's being eaten from play, and nothing in the Standard
Rules can then get at it again.

Note that, uncontroversially, one can only eat things with the 'edible'
either/or property, and also that, more controversially, one can only
eat things currently being held. This means that a player standing next
to a bush with berries who types EAT BERRIES will force a '(first taking
the berries)' action."

Report an actor eating (this is the standard report eating rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message eating action number 2
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message eating action number 3 for the noun.

Section SR4/3 - Actions which move the actor

Going is an action with past participle gone, applying to one visible thing.
The going action translates into I6 as "Go".

The specification of the going action is "This is the action which allows people
to move from one room to another, using whatever map connections and doors are
to hand. The Standard Rules are written so that the noun can be either a
direction or a door in the location of the actor: while the player's commands
only lead to going actions with directions as nouns, going actions can also
happen as a result of entering actions, and then the noun can indeed be
a door."

The going action has a room called the room gone from (matched as "from").
The going action has an object called the room gone to (matched as "to").
The going action has an object called the door gone through (matched as "through").
The going action has an object called the vehicle gone by (matched as "by").
The going action has an object called the thing gone with (matched as "with").

Rule for setting action variables for going (this is the standard set going variables rule):
	now the thing gone with is the item-pushed-between-rooms;
	now the room gone from is the location of the actor;
	if the actor is in an enterable vehicle (called the carriage),
		now the vehicle gone by is the carriage;
	let the target be nothing;

	otherwise:
		if the noun is a door, let the target be the noun;
	if the target is a door:
		now the door gone through is the target;
		now the target is the other side of the target from the room gone from;

	stop the action with library message going action number 1 for H.

Check an actor going (this is the can't go through undescribed doors rule):
	if the door gone through is not nothing and the door gone through is undescribed,
		stop the action with library message going action number 2 for the room gone from.

		let the target be the room-or-door direction D from the room gone from;
	otherwise:
		if the noun is a door, let the target be the noun;
	if the target is a door:

	now the room gone to is the target.

Check an actor going (this is the can't go that way rule):
	if the room gone to is nothing:
		if the door gone through is nothing, stop the action with library
			message going action number 2 for the room gone from;
		stop the action with library message going action number 6 for the door gone through;

Carry out an actor going (this is the move player and vehicle rule):
	if the vehicle gone by is nothing,
		surreptitiously move the actor to the room gone to during going;
	otherwise
		surreptitiously move the vehicle gone by to the room gone to during going.

Carry out an actor going (this is the move floating objects rule):
	if the actor is the player,
		update backdrop positions.

Carry out an actor going (this is the check light in new location rule):
	if the actor is the player,
		surreptitiously reckon darkness.

Report an actor going (this is the describe room gone into rule):
	if the player is the actor:
		produce a room description with going spacing conventions;
	otherwise:
		if the noun is a direction:
			if the location is the room gone from:

			issue actor-based library message going action number 26;
			say ".";
			try looking;
			continue the action;
		say ".";

Entering is an action applying to one thing.
The entering action translates into I6 as "Enter".

The specification of the entering action is "Whereas the going action allows
people to move from one location to another in the model world, the entering
action is for movement inside a location: for instance, climbing into a cage
or sitting on a couch. (Entering is not allowed to change location, so any
attempt to enter a door is converted into a going action.) What makes
entering trickier than it looks is that the player may try to enter an
object which is itself inside, or part of, something else, which might in
turn be... and so on. To preserve realism, the implicitly pass through other
barriers rule automatically generates entering and exiting actions needed
to pass between anything which might be in the way: for instance, in a
room with two open cages, an actor in cage A who tries entering cage B first
has to perform an exiting action."

Check an actor entering (this is the convert enter door into go rule):
	if the noun is a door, convert to the going action on the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the convert enter compass direction into go rule):
	if the noun is a direction, convert to the going action on the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the can't enter what's already entered rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	if the local ceiling is the noun, stop the action with library message
		entering action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the can't enter what's not enterable rule):
	if the noun is not enterable, stop the action with library message
		entering action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the can't enter closed containers rule):
	if the noun is a closed container, stop the action with library message
		entering action number 3 for the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the can't enter something carried rule):
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	if the local ceiling is the actor, stop the action with library message
		entering action number 4 for the noun.

Check an actor entering (this is the implicitly pass through other barriers rule):
	if the holder of the actor is the holder of the noun, continue the action;
	let the local ceiling be the common ancestor of the actor with the noun;
	while the holder of the actor is not the local ceiling:
		let the target be the holder of the actor;
		issue library message entering action number 6 for the target;
		silently try the actor trying exiting;
		if the holder of the actor is the target, stop the action;
	if the holder of the actor is the noun, stop the action;
	if the holder of the actor is the holder of the noun, continue the action;
	let the target be the holder of the noun;
	if the noun is part of the target, let the target be the holder of the target;
	while the target is a thing:
		if the holder of the target is the local ceiling:
			issue library message entering action number 7 for the target;
			silently try the actor trying entering the target;
			if the holder of the actor is not the target, stop the action;
			convert to the entering action on the noun;
			continue the action;
		let the target be the holder of the target;

Carry out an actor entering (this is the standard entering rule):
	surreptitiously move the actor to the noun.

Report an actor entering (this is the standard report entering rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message entering action number 5 for the noun;
	otherwise if the noun is a container:
		issue actor-based library message entering action number 8 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message entering action number 9 for the noun;
	continue the action.

Report an actor entering (this is the describe contents entered into rule):
	if the actor is the player, describe locale for the noun.

Exiting is an action applying to nothing.
The exiting action translates into I6 as "Exit".
The exiting action has an object called the container exited from.

The specification of the exiting action is "Whereas the going action allows
people to move from one location to another in the model world, and the
entering action is for movement deeper inside the objects in a location,
the exiting action is for movement back out towards the main floor area.
Climbing out of a cupboard, for instance, is an exiting action. Exiting
when already in the main floor area of a room with a map connection to
the outside is converted to a going action. Finally, note that whereas
entering works for either containers or supporters, exiting is purely for
getting oneself out of containers: if the actor is on top of a supporter
instead, an exiting action is converted to the getting off action."

Setting action variables for exiting:
	now the container exited from is the holder of the actor.

Check an actor exiting (this is the convert exit into go out rule):
	let the local room be the location of the actor;
	if the container exited from is the local room:
		if the room-or-door outside from the local room is not nothing,
			convert to the going action on the outside;

Check an actor exiting (this is the can't exit when not inside anything rule):
	let the local room be the location of the actor;
	if the container exited from is the local room, stop the action with
		library message exiting action number 1 for the actor.

Check an actor exiting (this is the can't exit closed containers rule):
	if the actor is in a closed container (called the cage), stop the action
		with library message exiting action number 2 for the cage.

Check an actor exiting (this is the convert exit into get off rule):
	if the actor is on a supporter (called the platform),
		convert to the getting off action on the platform.

Carry out an actor exiting (this is the standard exiting rule):
	let the former exterior be the not-counting-parts holder of the container exited from;
	surreptitiously move the actor to the former exterior.

Report an actor exiting (this is the standard report exiting rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message exiting action number 3 for the container exited from;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message exiting action number 6 for the container exited from;
	continue the action.

Report an actor exiting (this is the describe room emerged into rule):
	if the actor is the player,
		produce a room description with going spacing conventions.

Getting off is an action with past participle got, applying to one thing.
The getting off action translates into I6 as "GetOff".

The specification of the getting off action is "The getting off action is for
actors who are currently on top of a supporter: perhaps standing on a platform,
but maybe only sitting on a chair or even lying down in bed. Unlike the similar
exiting action, getting off takes a noun: the platform, chair, bed or what
have you."

Check an actor getting off (this is the can't get off things rule):
	if the actor is on the noun, continue the action;
	if the actor is carried by the noun, continue the action;
	stop the action with library message getting off action number 1 for the noun.

Carry out an actor getting off (this is the standard getting off rule):
	let the former exterior be the not-counting-parts holder of the noun;
	surreptitiously move the actor to the former exterior.

Report an actor getting off (this is the standard report getting off rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message exiting action number 3 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message exiting action number 5 for the noun;
	continue the action.

Report an actor getting off (this is the describe room stood up into rule):
	if the actor is the player,
		produce a room description with going spacing conventions.

Section SR4/4 - Actions concerning the actor's vision

Looking is an action applying to nothing.
The looking action translates into I6 as "Look".

The specification of the looking action is "The looking action describes the
player's current room and any visible items, but is made more complicated
by the problem of visibility. Inform calculates this by dividing the room
into visibility levels. For an actor on the floor of a room, there is only
one such level: the room itself. But an actor sitting on a chair inside
a packing case which is itself on a gantry would have four visibility levels:
chair, case, gantry, room. The looking rules use a special phrase, 'the
visibility-holder of X', to go up from one level to the next: thus the
visibility-holder of the case is the gantry.

The 'visibility level count' is the number of levels which the player can
actually see, and the 'visibility ceiling' is the uppermost visible level.
For a player standing on the floor of a lighted room, this will be a count
of 1 with the ceiling set to the room. But a player sitting on a chair in
a closed opaque packing case would have visibility level count 2, and
visibility ceiling equal to the case. Moreover, light has to be available
in order to see anything at all: if the player is in darkness, the level
count is 0 and the ceiling is nothing.

Finally, note that several actions other than looking also produce room
descriptions in some cases. The most familiar is going, but exiting a
container or getting off a supporter will also generate a room description.
(The phrase used by the relevant rules is 'produce a room description with
going spacing conventions' and carry out or report rules for newly written
actions are welcome to use this too if they would like to. The spacing
conventions affect paragraph division, and note that the main description
paragraph may be omitted for a place not newly visited, depending on the
VERBOSE settings.) Room descriptions like this are produced by running the
check, carry out and report rules for looking, but are not subject to
before, instead or after rules: so they do not count as a new action. The
looking variable 'room-describing action' holds the action name of the
reason a room description is currently being made: if the player typed
LOOK, this will indeed be set to the looking action, but if we're
describing a room just reached by GO EAST, say, it will be set to the going
action. This can be used to customise carry out looking rules so that
different forms of description are used on going to a room as compared with
looking around while already there."

The looking action has an action-name called the room-describing action.
The looking action has a truth state called abbreviated form allowed.
The looking action has a number called the visibility level count.
The looking action has an object called the visibility ceiling.

Setting action variables for looking (this is the determine visibility ceiling
	rule):
	if the actor is the player, calculate visibility ceiling at low level;
	now the visibility level count is the visibility ceiling count calculated;
	now the visibility ceiling is the visibility ceiling calculated;
	now the room-describing action is the looking action.

Carry out looking (this is the room description heading rule):
	say bold type;
	if the visibility level count is 0:
		begin the printing the name of a dark room activity;
		if handling the printing the name of a dark room activity,
			issue miscellaneous library message number 71;
		end the printing the name of a dark room activity;
	otherwise if the visibility ceiling is the location:
		say "[visibility ceiling]";
	otherwise:
		say "[The visibility ceiling]";
	say roman type;
	let intermediate level be the visibility-holder of the actor;
	repeat with intermediate level count running from 2 to the visibility level count:
		issue library message looking action number 8 for the intermediate level;
		let the intermediate level be the visibility-holder of the intermediate level;
	say line break;
	say run paragraph on with special look spacing.

Carry out looking (this is the room description body text rule):
	if the visibility level count is 0:
		if set to abbreviated room descriptions, continue the action;
		if set to sometimes abbreviated	room descriptions and
			abbreviated form allowed is true and
			darkness witnessed is true,
			continue the action;
		begin the printing the description of a dark room activity;
		if handling the printing the description of a dark room activity,
			issue miscellaneous library message number 17;
		end the printing the description of a dark room activity;
	otherwise if the visibility ceiling is the location:
		if set to abbreviated room descriptions, continue the action;
		if set to sometimes abbreviated	room descriptions and abbreviated form
			allowed is true and the location is visited, continue the action;
		print the location's description;

Carry out looking (this is the room description paragraphs about objects rule):
	if the visibility level count is greater than 0:
		let the intermediate position be the actor;
		let the IP count be the visibility level count;
		while the IP count is greater than 0:
			now the intermediate position is marked for listing;
			let the intermediate position be the visibility-holder of the
				intermediate position;
			decrease the IP count by 1;
		let the top-down IP count be the visibility level count;
		while the top-down IP count is greater than 0:
			let the intermediate position be the actor;
			let the IP count be 0;
			while the IP count is less than the top-down IP count:
				let the intermediate position be the visibility-holder of the
					intermediate position;
				increase the IP count by 1;
			[if we ever support I6-style inside descriptions, here's where]
			describe locale for the intermediate position;
			decrease the top-down IP count by 1;
	continue the action;

Carry out looking (this is the check new arrival rule):
	if in darkness:
		now the darkness witnessed is true;
	otherwise:
		if the location is a room, now the location is visited;

Report an actor looking (this is the other people looking rule):
	if the actor is not the player,
		issue actor-based library message looking action number 9.

Examining is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
The examining action translates into I6 as "Examine".

The specification of the examining action is "The act of looking closely at
something. Note that the noun could be either a direction or a thing, which
is why the Standard Rules include the 'examine directions rule' to deal with
directions: it simply says 'You see nothing unexpected in that direction.'
and stops the action. (If you would like to handle directions differently,
list another rule instead of this one in the carry out examining rules.)

For arcane reasons to do with the Inform 6 library underlying what Inform
does, these rules test to see 'if the noun goes undescribed by source
text' (rather than more simply testing whether the description property
of the noun is blank). If so, we search (i.e., look inside) a container,
and show the status (switched on or off) of a device, but otherwise
give up with a bland response. For traditional reasons, we also show
the status of a device as a second paragraph even after any description
property has been printed: this is done by the examine described devices
rule."

Carry out examining (this is the examine undescribed containers rule):
	if the noun goes undescribed by source text and
		the noun is a container,
		convert to the searching action on the noun.

Carry out examining (this is the examine undescribed devices rule):
	if the noun goes undescribed by source text and
		the noun is a device,
		stop the action with library message examining action number 3
			for the noun.

Carry out examining (this is the examine undescribed things rule):
	if the noun goes undescribed by source text,
		stop the action with library message examining action number 2
			for the noun.

Carry out examining (this is the examine directions rule):
	if the noun is a direction,
		stop the action with library message examining action number 5
			for the noun.

Carry out examining (this is the standard examining rule):
	say "[the description of the noun][line break]".

Carry out examining (this is the examine described devices rule):
	if the noun is a device,
		stop the action with library message examining action number 3
			for the noun.

Report an actor examining (this is the report other people examining rule):
	if the actor is not the player,
		issue actor-based library message examining action number 4 for the noun.

Looking under is an action applying to one visible thing and requiring light.
The looking under action translates into I6 as "LookUnder".

The specification of the looking under action is "The standard Inform world
model does not have a concept of things being under other things, so this
action is only minimally provided by the Standard Rules, but it exists here
for traditional reasons (and because, after all, LOOK UNDER TABLE is the
sort of command which ought to be recognised even if it does nothing useful).
The action ordinarily either tells the player he finds nothing of interest,
or reports that somebody else has looked under something.

The usual way to make this action do something useful is to write a rule
like 'Instead of looking under the cabinet for the first time: now the
player has the silver key; say ...' and so on."

Carry out an actor looking under (this is the standard looking under rule):
	stop the action with library message looking under action number 2 for
		the noun.

Report an actor looking under (this is the report other people looking under rule):
	if the actor is not the player,
		issue actor-based library message looking under action number 3 for the noun.

Searching is an action applying to one thing and requiring light.
The searching action translates into I6 as "Search".

The specification of the searching action is "Searching looks at the contents
of an open or transparent container, or at the items on top of a supporter.
These are often mentioned in room descriptions already, and then the action
is unnecessary, but that wouldn't be true for something like a kitchen
cupboard which is scenery - mentioned in passing in a room description, but
not made a fuss of. Searching such a cupboard would then, by listing its
contents, give the player more information than the ordinary room description
shows.

The usual check rules restrict searching to containers and supporters: so
the Standard Rules do not allow the searching of people, for instance. But
it is easy to add instead rules ('Instead of searching Dr Watson: ...') or
even a new carry out rule ('Check searching someone (called the suspect): ...')
to extend the way searching normally works."

Check an actor searching (this is the can't search unless container or supporter rule):
	if the noun is not a container and the noun is not a supporter,
		stop the action with library message searching action number 4 for
			the noun.

Check an actor searching (this is the can't search closed opaque containers rule):
	if the noun is a closed opaque container,
		stop the action with library message searching action number 5 for
			the noun.

Report searching a container (this is the standard search containers rule):
	if the noun contains a described thing which is not scenery,
		issue library message searching action number 7 for the noun;
	otherwise
		issue library message searching action number 6 for the noun.

Report searching a supporter (this is the standard search supporters rule):
	if the noun supports a described thing which is not scenery,
		issue library message searching action number 3 for the noun;
	otherwise
		issue library message searching action number 2 for the noun.

Report an actor searching (this is the report other people searching rule):
	if the actor is not the player,
		issue actor-based library message searching action number 8 for the noun.

Consulting it about is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
The consulting it about action translates into I6 as "Consult".

The specification of the consulting it about action is "Consulting is a very
flexible and potentially powerful action, but only because it leaves almost
all of the work to the author to deal with directly. The idea is for it to
respond to commands such as LOOK UP HENRY FITZROY IN HISTORY BOOK, where
the topic would be the snippet of command HENRY FITZROY and the thing would
be the book.

The Standard Rules simply parry such requests by saying that the player finds
nothing of interest. All interesting responses must be provided by the author,
using rules like 'Instead of consulting the history book about...'"

Report an actor consulting something about (this is the block consulting rule):
	if the actor is the player,
		issue library message consulting it about action number 1 for the noun;
	otherwise
		issue actor-based library message consulting it about action number 2 for the noun.

Section SR4/5 - Actions which change the state of things

Locking it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.
The locking it with action translates into I6 as "Lock".

The specification of the locking it with action is "Locking is the act of
using an object such as a key to ensure that something such as a door or
container cannot be opened unless first unlocked. (Only closed things can be
locked.)

Locking can be performed on any kind of thing which provides the either/or
properties lockable, locked, openable and open. The 'can't lock without a lock
rule' tests to see if the noun both provides the lockable property, and if
it is in fact lockable: it is then assumed that the other properties can
safely be checked. In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both
satisfy these requirements.

We can create a new kind on which opening, closing, locking and unlocking
will work thus: 'A briefcase is a kind of thing. A briefcase can be openable.
A briefcase can be open. A briefcase can be lockable. A briefcase can be
locked. A briefcase is usually openable, lockable, open and unlocked.'

Inform checks whether the key fits using the 'can't lock without the correct
key rule'. To satisfy this, the actor must be directly holding the second
noun, and it must be the current value of the 'matching key' property for
the noun. (This property is seldom referred to directly because it is
automatically set by assertions like 'The silver key unlocks the wicket
gate.')

The Standard Rules provide locking and unlocking actions at a fairly basic
level: they can be much enhanced using the extension Locksmith by Emily
Short, which is included with all distributions of Inform."

Check an actor locking something with (this is the can't lock without a lock rule):
	if the noun provides the property lockable and the noun is lockable,
		continue the action;
	stop the action with library message locking it with action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor locking something with (this is the can't lock what's already
	locked rule):
	if the noun is locked,
		stop the action with library message locking it with action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor locking something with (this is the can't lock what's open rule):
	if the noun is open,
		stop the action with library message locking it with action number 3 for the noun.

Check an actor locking something with (this is the can't lock without the correct key rule):
	if the holder of the second noun is not the actor or
		the noun does not provide the property matching key or
		the matching key of the noun is not the second noun,
		stop the action with library message locking it with action number 4 for the second noun.

Carry out an actor locking something with (this is the standard locking rule):
	now the noun is locked.

Report an actor locking something with (this is the standard report locking rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message locking it with action number 5 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		if the actor is visible, issue actor-based library message locking it with
			action number 6 for the noun;

Unlocking it with is an action applying to one thing and one carried thing.
The unlocking it with action translates into I6 as "Unlock".

The specification of the unlocking it with action is "Unlocking undoes the
effect of locking, and renders the noun openable again provided that the
actor is carrying the right key (which must be the second noun).

Unlocking can be performed on any kind of thing which provides the either/or
properties lockable, locked, openable and open. The 'can't unlock without a lock
rule' tests to see if the noun both provides the lockable property, and if
it is in fact lockable: it is then assumed that the other properties can
safely be checked. In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both
satisfy these requirements.

We can create a new kind on which opening, closing, locking and unlocking
will work thus: 'A briefcase is a kind of thing. A briefcase can be openable.
A briefcase can be open. A briefcase can be lockable. A briefcase can be
locked. A briefcase is usually openable, lockable, open and unlocked.'

Inform checks whether the key fits using the 'can't unlock without the correct
key rule'. To satisfy this, the actor must be directly holding the second
noun, and it must be the current value of the 'matching key' property for
the noun. (This property is seldom referred to directly because it is
automatically set by assertions like 'The silver key unlocks the wicket
gate.')

The Standard Rules provide locking and unlocking actions at a fairly basic
level: they can be much enhanced using the extension Locksmith by Emily
Short, which is included with all distributions of Inform."

Check an actor unlocking something with (this is the can't unlock without a lock rule):
	if the noun provides the property lockable and the noun is lockable,
		continue the action;
	stop the action with library message unlocking it with action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor unlocking something with (this is the can't unlock what's already unlocked rule):
	if the noun is not locked,
		stop the action with library message unlocking it with action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor unlocking something with (this is the can't unlock without the correct key rule):
	if the holder of the second noun is not the actor or
		the noun does not provide the property matching key or
		the matching key of the noun is not the second noun,
		stop the action with library message unlocking it with action number 3 for the
			second noun.

Carry out an actor unlocking something with (this is the standard unlocking rule):
	now the noun is not locked.

Report an actor unlocking something with (this is the standard report unlocking rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message unlocking it with action number 4 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		if the actor is visible, issue actor-based library message unlocking it with
			action number 5 for the noun;

Switching on is an action applying to one thing.
The switching on action translates into I6 as "SwitchOn".

The specification of the switching on action is "The switching on and switching
off actions are for the simplest kind of machinery operation: they are for
objects representing machines (or more likely parts of machines), which are
considered to be either off or on at any given time.

The actions are intended to be used where the noun is a device, but in fact
they could work just as well with any kind which can be 'switched on' or
'switched off'."

Check an actor switching on (this is the can't switch on unless switchable rule):
	if the noun provides the property switched on, continue the action;
	stop the action with library message switching on action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor switching on (this is the can't switch on what's already on rule):
	if the noun is switched on,
		stop the action with library message switching on action number 2 for the noun.

Carry out an actor switching on (this is the standard switching on rule):
	now the noun is switched on.

Report an actor switching on (this is the standard report switching on rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message switching on action number 3
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message switching on action number 4 for the noun;

Switching off is an action applying to one thing.
The switching off action translates into I6 as "SwitchOff".

The specification of the switching off action is "The switching off and switching
on actions are for the simplest kind of machinery operation: they are for
objects representing machines (or more likely parts of machines), which are
considered to be either off or on at any given time.

The actions are intended to be used where the noun is a device, but in fact
they could work just as well with any kind which can be 'switched on' or
'switched off'."

Check an actor switching off (this is the can't switch off unless switchable rule):
	if the noun provides the property switched on, continue the action;
	stop the action with library message switching off action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor switching off (this is the can't switch off what's already off rule):
	if the noun is switched off,
		stop the action with library message switching off action number 2 for the noun.

Carry out an actor switching off (this is the standard switching off rule):
	now the noun is switched off.

Report an actor switching off (this is the standard report switching off rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message switching off action number 3
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message switching off action number 4 for the noun;

Opening is an action applying to one thing.
The opening action translates into I6 as "Open".

The specification of the opening action is "Opening makes something no longer
a physical barrier. The action can be performed on any kind of thing which
provides the either/or properties openable and open. The 'can't open unless
openable rule' tests to see if the noun both can be and actually is openable.
(It is assumed that anything which can be openable can also be open.)
In the Standard Rules, the container and door kinds both satisfy these
requirements.

In the event that the thing to be opened is also lockable, we are forbidden
to open it when it is locked. Both containers and doors can be lockable,
but the opening and closing actions would also work fine with kinds which
cannot be.

We can create a new kind on which opening and closing will work thus:
'A case file is a kind of thing. A case file can be openable.
A case file can be open. A case file is usually openable and closed.'

The meaning of open and closed is different for different kinds of thing.
When a container is closed, that means people outside cannot reach in,
and vice versa; when a door is closed, people cannot use the 'going' action
to pass through it. If we were to create a new kind such as 'case file',
we would also need to write rules to make the open and closed properties
interesting for this kind."

Check an actor opening (this is the can't open unless openable rule):
	if the noun provides the property openable and the noun is openable,
		continue the action;
	stop the action with library message opening action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor opening (this is the can't open what's locked rule):
	if the noun provides the property lockable and the noun is locked,
		stop the action with library message opening action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor opening (this is the can't open what's already open rule):
	if the noun is open,
		stop the action with library message opening action number 3 for the noun.

Carry out an actor opening (this is the standard opening rule):
	now the noun is open.

Report an actor opening (this is the reveal any newly visible interior rule):
	if the actor is the player and
		the noun is an opaque container and
		the first thing held by the noun is not nothing and
		the noun does not enclose the actor,
		stop the action with library message opening action number 4 for the noun.

Report an actor opening (this is the standard report opening rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message opening action number 5 for the noun;
	otherwise if the player can see the actor:
		issue actor-based library message opening action number 6 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message opening action number 7 for the noun;

Closing is an action applying to one thing.
The closing action translates into I6 as "Close".

The specification of the closing action is "Closing makes something into
a physical barrier. The action can be performed on any kind of thing which
provides the either/or properties openable and open. The 'can't close unless
openable rule' tests to see if the noun both can be and actually is openable.
(It is assumed that anything which can be openable can also be open, and
hence can also be closed.) In the Standard Rules, the container and door
kinds both satisfy these requirements.

We can create a new kind on which opening and closing will work thus:
'A case file is a kind of thing. A case file can be openable.
A case file can be open. A case file is usually openable and closed.'

we would also need to write rules to make the open and closed properties
interesting for this kind."

Check an actor closing (this is the can't close unless openable rule):
	if the noun provides the property openable and the noun is openable,
		continue the action;
	stop the action with library message closing action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor closing (this is the can't close what's already closed rule):
	if the noun is closed,
		stop the action with library message closing action number 2 for the noun.

Carry out an actor closing (this is the standard closing rule):
	now the noun is closed.

Report an actor closing (this is the standard report closing rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message closing action number 3 for the noun;
	otherwise if the player can see the actor:
		issue actor-based library message closing action number 4 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message closing action number 5 for the noun;

Wearing is an action with past participle worn, applying to one carried thing.
The wearing action translates into I6 as "Wear".

The specification of the wearing action is "The Standard Rules give Inform
only a simple model of clothing. A thing can be worn only if it has the
either/or property of being 'wearable'. (Typing a sentence like 'Mr Jones
wears the Homburg hat.' automatically implies that the hat is wearable,
which is why we only seldom need to use the word 'wearable' directly.)
There is no checking of how much or how little any actor is wearing, or
how incongruous this may appear: nor any distinction between under or
over-clothes.

To put on an article of clothing, the actor must be directly carrying it,
as enforced by the 'can't wear what's not held rule'."

Check an actor wearing (this is the can't wear what's not clothing rule):
	if the noun is not a thing or the noun is not wearable,
		stop the action with library message wearing action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor wearing (this is the can't wear what's not held rule):
	if the holder of the noun is not the actor,
		stop the action with library message wearing action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor wearing (this is the can't wear what's already worn rule):
	if the actor is wearing the noun,
		stop the action with library message wearing action number 3 for the noun.

Carry out an actor wearing (this is the standard wearing rule):
	now the actor wears the noun.

Report an actor wearing (this is the standard report wearing rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message wearing action number 4
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message wearing action number 5
		for the noun.

Taking off is an action with past participle taken, applying to one carried thing.
The taking off action translates into I6 as "Disrobe".

The specification of the taking off action is "The Standard Rules give Inform
only a simple model of clothing. A thing can be worn only if it has the
either/or property of being 'wearable'. (Typing a sentence like 'Mr Jones
wears the Homburg hat.' automatically implies that the hat is wearable,
which is why we only seldom need to use the word 'wearable' directly.)
There is no checking of how much or how little any actor is wearing, or
how incongruous this may appear: nor any distinction between under or
over-clothes.

When an article of clothing is taken off, it becomes a thing directly
carried by its former wearer, rather than being (say) dropped onto the floor."

Check an actor taking off (this is the can't take off what's not worn rule):
	if the actor is not wearing the noun,
		stop the action with library message taking off action number 1 for the noun.

Carry out an actor taking off (this is the standard taking off rule):
	now the actor carries the noun.

Report an actor taking off (this is the standard report taking off rule):
	if the actor is the player, issue library message taking off action number 2
		for the noun;
	otherwise issue actor-based library message taking off action number 3 for the noun.

Section SR4/6 - Actions concerning other people

Giving it to is an action with past participle given, applying to one carried thing and one thing.
The giving it to action translates into I6 as "Give".

The specification of the giving it to action is "This action is indexed by
Inform under 'Actions concerning other people', but it could just as easily
have gone under 'Actions concerning the actor's possessions' because -
like dropping, putting it on or inserting it into - this is an action
which gets rid of something being carried.

The Standard Rules implement this action fully - if it reaches the carry
out and report rulebooks, then the item is indeed transferred to the
recipient, and this is properly reported. But giving something to
somebody is not like putting something on a shelf: the recipient has
to agree. The final check rule, the 'block giving rule', assumes that
the recipient does not consent - so the gift fails to happen. The way
to make the giving action use its abilities fully is to replace the
block giving rule with a rule which makes a more sophisticated decision
about who will accept what from whom, and only blocks some attempts,
letting others run on into the carry out and report rules."

Check an actor giving something to (this is the can't give what you haven't got rule):
	if the actor is not the holder of the noun,
		stop the action with library message giving it to action number 1 for the noun.

Check an actor giving something to (this is the can't give to yourself rule):
	if the actor is the second noun,
		stop the action with library message giving it to action number 2 for the noun.

Check an actor giving something to (this is the can't give to a non-person rule):
	if the second noun is not a person,
		stop the action with library message giving it to action number 4 for the
			second noun.

Check an actor giving something to (this is the block giving rule):
	stop the action with library message giving it to action number 3 for the
		second noun.

Carry out an actor giving something to (this is the standard giving rule):
	move the noun to the second noun.

Report an actor giving something to (this is the standard report giving rule):
	if the actor is the player:
		issue library message giving it to action number 5 for the noun;
	otherwise if the second noun is the player:
		issue actor-based library message giving it to action number 6 for the noun;
	otherwise:
		issue actor-based library message giving it to action number 7 for the noun;

Showing it to is an action with past participle shown, applying to one carried thing
	and one visible thing.
The showing it to action translates into I6 as "Show".

The specification of the showing it to action is "Anyone can show anyone
else something which they are carrying, but not some nearby piece of
scenery, say - so this action is suitable for showing the emerald locket
to Katarina, but not showing the Orange River Rock Room to Mr Douglas.

The Standard Rules implement this action in only a minimal way, checking
that it makes sense but then blocking all such attempts with a message
such as 'Katarina is not interested.' - this is the task of the 'block
showing rule'. As a result, there are no carry out or report rules. To
make it into a systematic and interesting action, we would need to
unlist the block showing rule and then to write carry out and report
rules: but usually for IF purposes we only need to make a handful of
special cases of showing work properly, and for those we can simply
write Instead rules to handle them."

Check an actor showing something to (this is the can't show what you haven't
	got rule):
	if the actor is not the holder of the noun,
		stop the action with library message showing it to action number 1
			for the noun.

Check an actor showing something to (this is the convert show to yourself to
	examine rule):
	if the actor is the second noun,
		convert to the examining action on the noun.

	stop the action with library message showing it to action number 2
		for the second noun.

Waking is an action with past participle woken, applying to one thing.
The waking action translates into I6 as "WakeOther".

The specification of the waking action is "This is the act of jostling
a sleeping person to wake him or her up, and it finds its way into the
Standard Rules only for historical reasons. Inform does not by default
provide any model for people being asleep or awake, so this action does
not do anything in the standard implementation: instead, it is always
stopped by the block waking rule."

Check an actor waking (this is the block waking rule):
	stop the action with library message waking action number 1 for the noun.

Throwing it at is an action with past participle thrown, applying to one carried
	thing and one visible thing.
The throwing it at action translates into I6 as "ThrowAt".

The specification of the throwing it at action is "Throwing something at
someone or something is difficult for Inform to model. So many considerations
apply: just because the actor can see the target, does it follow that the
target can accurately hit it? What if the projectile is heavy, like an
anvil, or something not easily aimable, like a feather? What if there
is a barrier in the way, like a cage with bars spaced so that only items
of a certain size get through? And then: what should happen as a result?
Will the projectile break, or do damage, or fall to the floor, or into
a container or onto a supporter? And so on.

Because it seems hopeless to try to model this in any general way,
Inform instead provides the action for the user to attach specific rules to.
The check rules in the Standard Rules simply require that the projectile
is not an item of clothing still worn (this will be relevant for women
attending a Tom Jones concert) but then, in either the 'futile to throw
things at inanimate objects rule' or the 'block throwing at rule', will
refuse to carry out the action with a bland message.

To make throwing do something, then, we must either write Instead rules
for special circumstances, or else unlist these check rules and write
suitable carry out and report rules to pick up the thread."

Check an actor throwing something at (this is the implicitly remove thrown clothing rule):
	if the actor is wearing the noun:
		issue library message dropping action number 3 for the noun;
		silently try the actor trying taking off the noun;
		if the actor is wearing the noun, stop the action;

Check an actor throwing something at (this is the futile to throw things at inanimate
	objects rule):
	if the second noun is not a person,
		stop the action with library message throwing it at action number 1
			for the second noun.

Check an actor throwing something at (this is the block throwing at rule):
	stop the action with library message throwing it at action number 2
		for the noun.

Attacking is an action applying to one thing.
The attacking action translates into I6 as "Attack".

The specification of the attacking action is "Violence is seldom the answer,
and attempts to attack another person are normally blocked as being unrealistic
or not seriously meant. (I might find a shop assistant annoying, but IF is
not Grand Theft Auto, and responding by killing him is not really one of
my options.) So the Standard Rules simply block attempts to fight people,
but the action exists for rules to make exceptions."

Check an actor attacking (this is the block attacking rule):
	stop the action with library message attacking action number 1 for the noun.

Kissing is an action applying to one thing.
The kissing action translates into I6 as "Kiss".

The specification of the kissing action is "Possibly because Inform was
originally written by an Englishman, attempts at kissing another person are
normally blocked as being unrealistic or not seriously meant. So the
Standard Rules simply block attempts to kiss people, but the action exists
for rules to make exceptions."

Check an actor kissing (this is the kissing yourself rule):
	if the noun is the actor,
		stop the action with library message touching action number 3 for the noun.

Check an actor kissing (this is the block kissing rule):
	stop the action with library message kissing action number 1 for the noun.

Answering it that is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
The answering it that action translates into I6 as "Answer".

The specification of the answering it that action is "The Standard Rules do
not include any systematic way to handle conversation: instead, Inform is
set up so that it is as easy as we can make it to write specific rules
handling speech in particular games, and so that if no such rules are
written then all attempts to communicate are gracefully if not very
interestingly rejected.

The topic here can be any double-quoted text, which can itself contain
tokens in square brackets: see the documentation on Understanding.

Answering is an action existing so that the player can say something free-form
to somebody else. A convention of IF is that a command such as DAPHNE, TAKE
MASK is a request to Daphne to perform an action: if the persuasion rules in
force mean that she consents, the action 'Daphne taking the mask' does
indeed then result. But if the player types DAPHNE, 12375 or DAPHNE, GREAT
HEAVENS - or anything else not making sense as a command - the action
'answering Daphne that ...' will be generated.

The name of the action arises because it is also caused by typing, say,
ANSWER 12375 when Daphne (say) has asked a question."

Report an actor answering something that (this is the block answering rule):
	stop the action with library message answering it that action number 1
		for the noun.

Telling it about is an action with past participle told, applying to one thing and one topic.
The telling it about action translates into I6 as "Tell".

The specification of the telling it about action is "The Standard Rules do
not include any systematic way to handle conversation: instead, Inform is
set up so that it is as easy as we can make it to write specific rules
handling speech in particular games, and so that if no such rules are
written then all attempts to communicate are gracefully if not very
interestingly rejected.

The topic here can be any double-quoted text, which can itself contain
tokens in square brackets: see the documentation on Understanding.

Telling is an action existing only to catch commands like TELL ALEX ABOUT
GUITAR. Customarily in IF, such a command is shorthand which the player
accepts as a conventional form: it means 'tell Alex what I now know about
the guitar' and would make sense if the player had himself recently
discovered something significant about the guitar which might interest
Alex."

Check an actor telling something about (this is the telling yourself rule):
	if the actor is the noun,
		stop the action with library message telling it about action number 1
			for the noun.

Report an actor telling something about (this is the block telling rule):
	stop the action with library message telling it about action number 2
		for the noun.

Asking it about is an action applying to one thing and one topic.
The asking it about action translates into I6 as "Ask".

The specification of the asking it about action is "The Standard Rules do
not include any systematic way to handle conversation: instead, Inform is
set up so that it is as easy as we can make it to write specific rules
handling speech in particular games, and so that if no such rules are
written then all attempts to communicate are gracefully if not very
interestingly rejected.

The topic here can be any double-quoted text, which can itself contain
tokens in square brackets: see the documentation on Understanding.

Asking is an action existing only to catch commands like ASK STEPHEN ABOUT
PENELOPE. Customarily in IF, such a command is shorthand which the player
accepts as a conventional form: it means 'engage Mary in conversation and
try to find out what she might know about'. It's understood as a convention
of the genre that Mary should not be expected to respond in cases where
there is no reason to suppose that she has anything relevant to pass on -
ASK JANE ABOUT RICE PUDDING, for instance, need not conjure up a recipe
even if Jane is a 19th-century servant and therefore almost certainly
knows one."

Report an actor asking something about (this is the block asking rule):
	stop the action with library message asking it about action number 1
		for the noun.

Asking it for is an action applying to two things.
The asking it for action translates into I6 as "AskFor".

The specification of the asking it for action is "The Standard Rules do
not include any systematic way to handle conversation, but this is
action is not quite conversation: it doesn't involve any spoken text as
such. It exists to catch commands like ASK SALLY FOR THE EGG WHISK,
where the whisk is something which Sally has and the player can see.

Slightly oddly, but for historical reasons, an actor asking himself for
something is treated to an inventory listing instead. All other cases
are converted to the giving action: that is, ASK SALLY FOR THE EGG WHISK
is treated as if it were SALLY, GIVE ME THE EGG WHISK - an action for
Sally to perform and which then follows rules for giving.

To ask for information or something intangible, see the asking it about
action."

Check an actor asking something for (this is the asking yourself for something rule):
	if the actor is the noun and the actor is the player,
		try taking inventory instead.

Check an actor asking something for (this is the translate asking for to giving rule):
	convert to request of the noun to perform giving it to action with the
		second noun and the actor.

Section SR4/7 - Actions which are checked but then do nothing unless rules intervene

Waiting is an action applying to nothing.
The waiting action translates into I6 as "Wait".

The specification of the waiting action is "The inaction action: where would
we be without waiting? Waiting does not cause time to pass by - that happens
anyway - but represents a positive choice by the actor not to fill that time.
It is an action so that rules can be attached to it: for instance, we could
imagine that a player who consciously decides to sit and wait might notice
something which a busy player does not, and we could write a rule accordingly.

Note the absence of check or carry out rules - anyone can wait, at any time,
and it makes nothing happen."

Report an actor waiting (this is the standard report waiting rule):
	if the actor is the player, stop the action with library message waiting
		action number 1 for the actor;
	issue actor-based library message waiting action number 2.

Touching is an action applying to one thing.
The touching action translates into I6 as "Touch".

The specification of the touching action is "Touching is just that, touching
something without applying pressure: a touch-sensitive screen or a living
creature might react, but a standard push-button or lever will probably not.

In the Standard Rules there are no check touching rules, since touchability
is already a requirement of the noun for the action anyway, and no carry out
rules because nothing in the standard Inform world model reacts to
a mere touch - though report rules do mean that attempts to touch other
people provoke a special reply."

Report an actor touching (this is the report touching yourself rule):
	if the noun is the actor:
		if the actor is the player, issue library message touching action number 3
			for the noun;
		otherwise issue actor-based library message touching action number 4;
		stop the action;
	continue the action.

The specification of the waving action is "Waving in this sense is like
waving a sceptre: the item to be waved must be directly held (or worn)
by the actor.

nothing in the standard Inform world model which reacts to it. The action
is provided for authors to hang more interesting behaviour onto for special
cases: say, waving a particular rusty iron rod with a star on the end."

Check an actor waving (this is the can't wave what's not held rule):
	if the actor is not the holder of the noun,

		for the noun;

something not grossly larger than the actor by an amount which would not
substantially move it.

In the Standard Rules there are no carry out rules for this action because

a large object, not being carried, so that the actor pushes it from one room
to another: for instance, pushing a bale of hay to the east.

This is rapidly converted into a special form of the going action. If the
noun object has the either/or property 'pushable between rooms', then the
action is converted to going by the 'standard pushing in directions rule'.
If that going action succeeds, then the original pushing it to action
stops; it's only if that fails that we run on into the 'block pushing in
directions rule', which then puts an end to the matter."

Unicode Character Names ends here.

---- DOCUMENTATION ----

This extension was mechanically generated from the Unicode 4.1 draft.

It includes every named Unicode character in the hexadecimal ranges: Latin (0x0020 to 0x0250), Greek and Cyrillic (0x0370 to 0x0530), Hebrew (0x0590 to 0x0600), Latin and Greek additions (0x1E00 to 0x2000), currency symbols (0x20A0 to 0x20D0), miscellaneous symbols (0x2100 to 0x2400), box drawing shapes (0x2500 to 0x2700), Braille (0x2800 to 0x2900), and arrows (0x2B00 to 0x2C00), where in each case the range includes the lower number but not the upper.

If names for Unicode characters outside these ranges are needed, use the alternative Unicode Full Character Names extension instead.

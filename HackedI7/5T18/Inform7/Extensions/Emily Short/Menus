---- Documentation ----

Menus provides a table-based way to display menus to the player.

To create a menu, make a table with columns called "title", "subtable", "description", and "toggle". 

"Title" should be the name of the option we want the player to see.

"Subtable" can be another menu table. If we do not want this option to trigger a new table, we should leave it as "--", unless this is the first row of a new menu table. In that case, we should fill it in with "a table-name".

"Description" is some text that will be printed when the option is selected. We can fill it in with as much information as we like. If a "subtable" or "toggle" are provided, these will override the effects of the content entirely.

"Toggle" is a rule is carried out when the option is chosen. In theory, this rule could be absolutely anything. In practice, this is mostly useful for giving the player a table of setting options which he can toggle on and off.

Example: * Tabulation - A simple table of hints and help (see also Basic Help Menu).

For instance our Table of Options might look like this:

	*: "Tabulation" by Secretive J.
	
	Include Menus by Emily Short.

	Table of Options
	title	subtable	description	toggle
	"Introduction to [story title]"	a table-name	"This is a simple demonstration [story genre] game."	a rule
	"Settings"	Table of Setting Options	--	--
	"About the Author"	--	"[story author] is too reclusive to wish to disseminate any information. Sorry."	--
	"Hints"	Table of Hints	--	--

	Table of Setting Options
	title	subtable	description	toggle
	"[if notify mode is on]Score notification on[otherwise]Score notification off[end if]"	--	--	switch notification status rule

	To decide whether notify mode is on:
		(- notify_mode -);

	This is the switch notification status rule:
		if notify mode is on, try switching score notification off;
		otherwise try switching score notification on.

	[After each activation of the toggle rule, the menu redraws itself, so the player will see "score notification on" change to "score notification off" (and vice versa).]

	[Menus also provides for the case where we would like to display hints and give the player the option of revealing more and more detailed instructions. To this end, there is a special form for tables that lead to hints and tables which contain the hints themselves. The table leading to hints should look like this:]

	Table of Hints
	title	subtable	description	toggle
	"How do I reach the mastodon's jawbone?"	Table of Mastodon Hints		""	hint toggle rule
	"How can I make Leaky leave me alone?"	Table of Leaky Hints	""	hint toggle rule

	[where the toggle is always "hint toggle rule", and the subtable is always a table containing the hints themselves. A table of hints consists of just two columns, and one of those is for internal bookkeepping and should be initialized to contain a number. So:]

	Table of Mastodon Hints
	hint	used
	"Have you tried Dr. Seaton's Patent Arm-Lengthening Medication?"	a number
	"It's in the pantry."
	"Under some cloths."	

	Table of Leaky Hints
	hint	used
	"Perhaps it would help if you knew something about Leaky's personality."
	"Have you read the phrenology text in the library?"	
	"Have you found Dr. Seaton's plaster phrenology head?"	
	"Now you just need a way to compare this to Leaky's skull."	
	"Too bad he won't sit still."	
	"But he has been wearing a hat. Perhaps you could do something with that."
	"You'll need to get it off his head first."	
	"Have you found the fishing pole?"	
	"And the wire?"	
	"Wait on the balcony until Leaky passes by underneath on his way to the Greenhouse."	
	"FISH FOR THE HAT WITH THE HOOK ON THE WIRE."	
	"Now you'll have to find out what the hat tells you."	
	"Putting it on the phrenology head might allow you to compare."	
	"Of course, if you do that, you'll reshape the felt. Hope you saved a game!"
	"You need a way to preserve the stiffness of the hat."	
	"Have you found the plaster of paris?"	
	"And the water?"	
	"And the kettle?"	

	[...etc. (Hints 19-135 omitted for brevity.)]

	[Because the toggle rule is always consulted when the player selects an option and before any other default behavior occurs, we can use this rule to override normal menu behavior more or less however we like. The hint toggle rule is just one example.]

	[Finally, if we wanted to create a HELP command that would summon our menu, we would then add this:]

	Understand "help" or "hint" or "hints" or "about" or "info" as asking for help.

	Asking for help is an action out of world.
	
	Carry out asking for help:
		change the current menu to the Table of Options; 
		carry out the displaying activity;
		clear the screen;
		try looking.
		
	The Cranial Capacity Calculation Chamber is a room. Leaky is a man in the Chamber. Leaky wears a pair of overalls and some muddy boots. He is carrying a fishing rod.

The displaying activity displays whatever is set as the current menu, so we must set the current menu before activating the activity. Afterward it is a good idea to clear the screen before returning to regular play.

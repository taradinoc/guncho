*** Bug report form for Inform 7 Public Beta ***

Inform consists of a user interface, specific either to Mac OS X
or to Windows, together with an underlying suite of software common
to both. If you find a problem with the OS X user interface, please
report it to Andrew Hunter (andrew@logicalshift.co.uk); if with the
Windows user interface, please report it to David Kinder
(davidk.kinder@virgin.net).

This form is provided for reporting bugs in the underlying software.
For instance, if you click Go to translate a source text and the
Errors panel comes up to report that either Inform 7 or Inform 6
(which is used as a component) have failed, then this is the place
to report it; or if you are reasonably sure that your source text
is translating into something which does not do what the documentation
says it should.

Please check that you are using the current build of the software
before reporting a bug.

Please use a fresh copy of the form for each different problem found,
and email to Graham Nelson (graham@gnelson.demon.co.uk), using a
subject line which begins "[I7]" and then gives a brief note of the
problem: for instance, "[I7] Kinds don't work". Lastly - many thanks
indeed for your time and trouble.

2. The nature of the problem. Please put an X in one of these boxes:

[  ]  The source text looks legal, but generates Problem messages
[  ]  The source text looks legal, and generates no Problem messages, but
      then generates errors when fed into Inform 6
[  ]  The source looks legal and produces a playable game, but
      the game does not do what it should

[  ]  The source looks illegal, but doesn't generate a Problem, so
      that compilation finishes apparently normally
[  ]  The source looks illegal, but generates errors when fed into
      Inform 6 rather than generating a Problem message as it should
[  ]  The source looks illegal and does generate a Problem, but
      with an unhelpful or badly worded error message. (If so, please
      feel free to draft a suggestion for a better one - see below.)

[  ]  Attempting to compile this source crashes the Inform 7 compiler.
[  ]  Attempting to compile this source hangs the Inform 7 compiler,
      so that it never finishes.

3. What is the build number of the compiler you are using? (This will
be a four-character code such as 2F32 or 3K10.) Please type here:

4. Please paste in the source which exhibits the problem. Please
experiment to find the simplest _complete game_ which offends -
experience shows this can often be done with a single room and
a couple of sentences. (It is hard to overstate how much this helps
us in problem-chasing.) Paste here:

5. What goes wrong? If the source generates error messages, please
paste them here (in plain text); if a playable game is produced but
which does the wrong thing, please paste a transcript, or say what
seems to be wrong.

6. Comments. If you have any comments about this problem, or ideas
about what may be causing it, or if you would like to suggest how
matters might be improved (for instance by offering a better-worded
Problem message), here's the place:

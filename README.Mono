GunchoConsole has been tested with Mono 2.0 on x86 Linux. To run it:

1. Build the server:
	
    $ make

2. Obtain the Linux tarball from inform7.com, and extract the compiler
binaries "ni" and "inform-6.31-biplatform" into HackedI7/<build>/Compilers.

3. Copy Guncho.Core/app.config to bin/GunchoConsole.exe.config, then edit it
to set appropriate values for CachePath, RealmDataPath, NiSkeletonPath,
LogPath, and NiInstallationsPath.

4. Start the server:

    $ mono bin/GunchoConsole.exe
